Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:09pm MST	Most my applications have just asked for the scores and my test number. They haven't asked for me to send them in officially. Is that bad?

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 8:07am MST	Do y'all have any opinions on colors etc? Like white flowers are usually for sympathy, but they also do colored arrangements for like &quot;happy memories&quot;

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:39pm MST	We're not even friends

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:38pm MST	I have to be here at 5:45, so I think we a should do something close
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:37pm MST	What would you like to do
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:37pm MST	Lol
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:37pm MST	then I can hang out for 4-6 hours
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:37pm MST	I have to go to my lab for 45 minutes
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:47pm MST	I have no clue. I don't have time to print though. I'm barely gonna make it on time
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:41pm MST	Paul can you confirm?
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:38pm MST	Fuck
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:01pm MST	?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 1:49pm MST	Not yet I didn't go to my lab today so I'm about to head to campus now
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 1:22pm MST	I would accept the shit out of myself.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:42pm MST	üçâ
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:41pm MST	I think I need the for loop
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:41pm MST	Forgot h is changing
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:40pm MST	I don't think so. Might be wrong. Don't you just have to do (f(1)-f(0.5))/0.5?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:34pm MST	Ok, so wouldn't it just be a small calculation. No loop?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:23pm MST	Hm I'm actually not sure what forward divided difference
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:16pm MST	Yeah I do that often, at least matlab tells you when you don't use something
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:11pm MST	Yep that looks like it works
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:10pm MST	Does this make sense ?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:47pm MST	Nope, since you don't have a criterion and you just have to do the first 4 and print the error
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:46pm MST	I wouldn't need the while loop anymore right?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:42pm MST	Yep, I saw that too. That'll work, and it'll just be a small modification of the sin and cos code.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:39pm MST	Yeah no problem ignore it what you said works
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:39pm MST	Yeah actually that would give the same result
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:38pm MST	Since it's f(2) I would use ln(1+1)
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:38pm MST	http://math2.org/math/expansion/log.htm
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:36pm MST	For 15, would I use the Taylor expansion for ln(1+X)?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:24pm MST	We're you able to run it?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 7:04pm MST	Oh that &amp;&amp; order &lt; 20 should not be there.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 7:03pm MST	Oh I didn't know you had MATLAB
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:58pm MST	What language?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:58pm MST	And I accidentally did 12 for cos but you can change it
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:56pm MST	The others I'm just pretty lost on. I haven't coded in anything that's not image analysis in a while
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:25pm MST	Ok so what's tripping you up about 4.12?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:23pm MST	Looking now
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:12pm MST	Did you get a chance to look at them?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	And Paul yeah that works, science engineering?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	That's basically how drones work
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:36pm MST	Yeah what language?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 1:47pm MST	üôèüôèüôè

Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 12, 2017 at 1:02pm MST	It's a good rule to drink by
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 12, 2017 at 1:02pm MST	Also, @Paul, I've adopted your &quot;I only drink booze that comes in glass&quot; rule.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 12, 2017 at 7:05am MST	@Jose Celaya my roommate is named Jose. Are you my roommate?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 11, 2017 at 8:27am MST	@Olivia Gorushi the Prednisone may be getting to me. My whole dream last night was really fucking wanting to do dips.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 8, 2017 at 7:51am MST	Is it better than aloe vera though?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 8, 2017 at 7:41am MST	Recommended treatment is calamine lotion. You can buy it any drug store, it's a pink liquid, should be near the band-aid/Neosporin section.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 8, 2017 at 7:33am MST	That is possible. Who's your dermatology cohort?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:24pm MST	Paul this is ok but I need to plot multiple box and whisker plots side by sidr
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:21pm MST	I mean for data. You have failed me.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:20pm MST	This is math shit jose
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:20pm MST	Meta-chart also works
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:19pm MST	Or actually a box and whisker plot would be optimal
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:17pm MST	What was that website you showed me where you could make different charts and graphs and shit
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:55pm MST	You could also have Lyme disease or any of those other shitty tick diseases
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:15pm MST	Well, then I got nothing. Unless you developed late onset atopic dermatitis (aka eczema) or psoriasis, my knowledge of skin afflictions has been exhausted.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:10pm MST	I think I've always had the constantly eating thing lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:05pm MST	30mg a day for three days, then 10 for three days and then finally 5 for three days.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:03pm MST	I'm almost done with it though and it's spread.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:02pm MST	How long have you had it?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:01pm MST	Hmmmm
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 4:53pm MST	But you're not 50+ with a history of chicken pox so I doubt you have shingles
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	I mean I could probably do that
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	Yup. I'm on season 11 now
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 3:41pm MST	I'm watching a show where Shepard from Grey's anatomy is a young gigalo

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:05pm MST	I know but I feel like I'm gonna die. I feel super stressed and I have no appetite and everytime I force myself to eat something I feel like I'm gonna vomit. It's terrible
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:04pm MST	Olivia you're dedicated as fuck

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:37pm MST	If it didn't include ER it's wrong.
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:35pm MST	He was meant to become and real estate movul

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:22pm MST	I mean for tests it makes sense to pray to 2chainz since he got a masters with a 4.0 but I need a doctor
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:21pm MST	And if you're going to pray to a rapper y'all should pray to Dr. Dre. Since he's a doctor.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:49pm MST	I'd rather get lit. I now understand why my dad partied for so long
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:48pm MST	You could sell crack
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:47pm MST	I've thought about it. I could get a job doing computer stuff. I could also do med school. I've always wanted to deliver a baby. I could also use my parent's house to build a real estate empire and become a slum lord.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:45pm MST	And no, I don't have anything better to do. I'd be sitting around watching netflix.

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:14pm MST	There's different tiers. You can definitely‚Äã do level 1 by yourself, maybe some level 2. I would avoid 3 and 4 unless you run into other people also battling.

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 6:04pm MST	Also, I am full of shit. I fucking hate writing personal statements
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 6:00pm MST	It's important to keep an efficient system even if that means peeing and brushing your teeth at the same time
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 5:56pm MST	I'm not sure if I want to do computer science or some weird shit I don't know about
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 5:55pm MST	Yup. Its pretty dope knowing what your thing is. Microbes are my thing.

Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:33pm MST	HOw is it so far?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:23pm MST	That's the message: girls are fucking assholes to each other. And they should stop.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:23pm MST	I don't know how I'm still sane, to be honest.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:23pm MST	What is the message about how shitty girls treat eachother?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:20pm MST	Yup. Scott is coming here because he hates Phoenix that much.

Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 29, 2017 at 5:10pm MST	She just sent out another, makes sense
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 28, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	Maybe they just need a ride.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, June 28, 2017 at 6:03pm MST	They're cool as fuck
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, June 28, 2017 at 2:20pm MST	I was cold today... It was baffling
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 5:07pm MST	Cool cool
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 5:07pm MST	No but the food is supposed to be pretty good.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	That surprises me
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	What?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	I really liked the first episode
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	And Mac and Dee are married in real life
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	That's pretty cool
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 5:03pm MST	Jose you know the waitress that Charlie is obsessed with?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 5:03pm MST	He seems crazy
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 5:03pm MST	Holy fuck cricket yes cricket is great.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 5:03pm MST	I haven't formed an opinion on this yet
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 5:02pm MST	Can't wait till you get to Cricket
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 5:02pm MST	Yup charlie
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 5:02pm MST	Lmao kinda like it's fine for old people to be racist cause they're fucking old
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 5:02pm MST	I'm on the one where Charlie has cancer
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 5:02pm MST	Frank is old school fucked up though so it's different
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 5:01pm MST	I heard about him
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 4:54pm MST	It's awesome
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 4:54pm MST	I know but you should've made me watch it
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 4:53pm MST	Couple guys here showed it to me
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 26, 2017 at 4:33am MST	I'm a fucking shark. I fucking love Mondays.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:41am MST	Look at all these fucking steaks I'm going to eat
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:36am MST	Ok good because that's what I was trying to convey to you
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:36am MST	I just remembered how many fucking cutting boards you have.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:34am MST	That's what she said
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:33am MST	Yeah but I have no place to put it. I have like one square foot of counter space on my kitchen
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:32am MST	That's a big deal. Your gotta fucking buy one.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:30am MST	My bed is super small and uncomfortable. The springs like jab into your back.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:29am MST	I'm zoodling right now
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:28am MST	Fuck that. I enjoy spending time with you guys. Not these kids.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:27am MST	That's why you gotta spend more time with them
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:25am MST	Yeah you go because you have FOMO or you say I was gonna stay home tonight but I didn't wanna get FOMO.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:24am MST	So basically when someone invites you to something and you kinda don't really feel like going but you reluctantly agree anyway because you don't want to be left out or miss something fun
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:23am MST	Have you guys ever heard of FOMO?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:22am MST	Then sleep and dream about food
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:22am MST	But I don't wanna get up...
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:22am MST	Go forth and gather food
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:21am MST	Fuck I should probably get out of bed and eat something
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:21am MST	Lmao true
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:21am MST	Olivia you already have president level security
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:20am MST	We have front desk staff 24/7, plus a security guard, plus keycard only access, plus an RA, plus you need your keycard to get into the apartment too
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:19am MST	Yeah, it's super secure here
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:16am MST	Olivia you're probably gonna be president
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:14am MST	It's been getting a little trappy here lately
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:12am MST	I know them I just don't like them lol
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:12am MST	Meet people Olivia
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:08am MST	If it wasn't for hanging out with the people here I would probably be bored as shit
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:08am MST	It's been like mid 70s for the last few days
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:06am MST	I missed Tucson so much by the 3rd day I basically swore to myself I'd never go farther than Phoenix again
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:05am MST	Y'all are ridiculous
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:05am MST	In Philadelphia there's hills, but you don't really see mountains until you drive out of the city
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:05am MST	Mountains are awesome
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:04am MST	Flat ass shit
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:04am MST	You have, like everyone in Tucson just says it's the smell of rain, but rain only smells like that in the Sonoran desert because of creosote, it's a bush
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:03am MST	But maybe I have and I don't remember
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:02am MST	Creosote, greasewood...You know when it rains or monsoons and the air smells really good and everyone says it smells like it's gonna rain?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:02am MST	There's like 2 white ish people in my group of 40
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:00am MST	The only thing I'll miss about Tucson is the smell of creosote. And good Mexican food. Literally the only things.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:59am MST	Every time I see a blinking red stop light I think of Tucson
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:59am MST	I like it here but I definitely miss Tucson
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:58am MST	And there is about the same amount of stuff downtown
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:58am MST	You're crazy. Indianapolis must really suck if Tucson is better
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:57am MST	Tucson's great
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:54am MST	...no
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:48am MST	Holy shit lol how much did you spend?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:48am MST	I know but I sprang for new wheels too
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:47am MST	Shits expensive
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:47am MST	I had to get new tires though
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:46am MST	Driving
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:41am MST	One more level to win
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:41am MST	Damn
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:39am MST	I like your hat
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:54pm MST	We're all going to dinner in 5
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:53pm MST	Some kind of NA always has to be extracted
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:52pm MST	Oh my god
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:51pm MST	How happy are you?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:50pm MST	Haha
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:46pm MST	I can't believe I talked to you for a whole year, while you kept this hideous secret
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:46pm MST	Wow. See I could have just given you all the pink ones the next time I'm eating starburst. But now I don't wanna.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:45pm MST	Friendship over
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:45pm MST	I actually don't like the pink ones. The yellow ones are ok but the orange ones are the best.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:44pm MST	I believe in myself though
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:44pm MST	Goddamit
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:44pm MST	Yeah
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:43pm MST	I have 2 now
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:43pm MST	You'll get more lucky eggs and more egg incubators at every multiple of 5 level, so 5, 10, 15, etc
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:42pm MST	Oh yeah I think I've heard of that
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:42pm MST	Then if you're evolving any new Pokemon, that bonus will also get doubled.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:41pm MST	Basically just horde the stuff you catch and hatch until you have ~60 pokemon to evolve, then hatch a lucky egg to give you double XP for 30 minutes.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:40pm MST	Oh yeah lol I'm at like 203 or something. See everytime you catch a pokemon for the first time and add it to your Pokedex, you get a bonus of 500 xp
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:38pm MST	That's pretty close, plus you still have a lot of pokemon to discover, whereas my Pokedex is almost complete, so that'll help you make up the difference. What's your Pokedex caught total?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:34pm MST	186,00
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:33pm MST	Very down
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:33pm MST	Haha
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:31pm MST	Lol we can do it Jose. Si se puede
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:28pm MST	There now it shared. Read and weep with me.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:27pm MST	At this rate you'll have to play for seven years
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:26pm MST	How do people reach level 40?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	Oh my gosh
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	By the time I hit it it probably won't be the cap anymore
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	That's gonna be a long time from now
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:22pm MST	I just got my first Muk from the raid I just did today, it was one of the last of the original 150 besides legendaries and regionals that I still needed.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:22pm MST	The internet lies
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:22pm MST	Oh I thought they were
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:19pm MST	They seem pretty cool
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:17pm MST	*caught 184. I do not currently have 184 lol
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:15pm MST	Personally, I try to make my buddy whatever is super rare and hard to find. Eevee used to be way more common but a lot of people complained, so I think they changed it.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:14pm MST	An eevee
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:09pm MST	Plus I just catch everything I see, and spin the stop at my dorm all the time.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:08pm MST	How long have you been playing?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:08pm MST	Omg. I've made that like today
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:08pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:06pm MST	How many pts is it from 18 to 19?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:04pm MST	Just get out there and grind
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:04pm MST	I haven't looked into Facebook yet
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	I don't know what it's at but it keeps going down
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	Goddamit
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	Im so close guys....
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:01pm MST	Sorry I was in a raid.
Jose Celaya	Friday, June 23, 2017 at 7:19am MST	Yeah but no one says &quot;un cuarto m√°s de diez&quot;
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 23, 2017 at 7:13am MST	Yo
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 23, 2017 at 5:47am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 22, 2017 at 7:10am MST	Holy fuck. Everything in my lab is taking so goddamn long, I feel like I'm high af or something.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 2:08pm MST	Yeah it looks pretty awesome, rain here is cool too but I feel like it's more boring somehow
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 1:54pm MST	I love it provided I'm adequately prepared if I'm in it. It's just cool with the clouds and stuff being in a really tall building.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 1:52pm MST	It's raining here again y'all
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 5:59pm MST	You fucking monster
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:33pm MST	Sorry I just found this and it is almost as amazing a rendition as the original. Holy God.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:31pm MST	To catch them is my real quest.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:31pm MST	I feel like you're yoda
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:31pm MST	Like no one ever was.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:30pm MST	We will train together to be the very best.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:30pm MST	I also believe
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:30pm MST	It's a big deal. I believe in you Jose. You can get to level 30.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:28pm MST	Right? It was on my birthday. I remember.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:28pm MST	Nah cause once you hit level 30, other players start taking you seriously. You get respect.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:27pm MST	I might get discouraged at that point
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:27pm MST	Wtf
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:26pm MST	500k
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:26pm MST	Yeah
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:25pm MST	How much from 30 to 32?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:25pm MST	I'm almost 80% of the way to level 31.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	I finally have someone else to play with
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	It's true Olivia
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	Like Aipom and Voltorb
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:23pm MST	Holy shit me too
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:22pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:21pm MST	Summer undergraduate internship program
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:12pm MST	Which I probably will anyway.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:10pm MST	I feel kind of bad because I'm sitting here in the breezeway watching the storm but I keep seeing people completely drenched and miserable.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:09pm MST	Right? I got back to my drom like 15 minutes before it started.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:32pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:32pm MST	Most expensive call girl ever.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:32pm MST	Holy shit I just spent way too much money. Oh well no take backs.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:31pm MST	You didn't do it
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:31pm MST	Show me the receipts you pussy
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 6:43pm MST	She's not cool enough to do it
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 5:57pm MST	That's not that big of a deal though.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 5:57pm MST	I'm sure it'll pay off over the long run
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 5:50pm MST	But then I gotta buy a coffee maker and a toaster...
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 5:26pm MST	Emanuel I need more of your help. How do you be a poor college student? I have to start saving if Scott is gonna spend all my money. How do I not starve. What do I buy. Help.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:39pm MST	This idea gets better and better.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:33pm MST	And 4th of July in Philly is the dopest shit ever from what I hear.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:33pm MST	You can do whatever the fuck you want
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:33pm MST	Plus fuck it I'm a grown ass adult.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:33pm MST	Perfect
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:28pm MST	From an emotional point of view, he'll feel nice that you're willing to do that to see him, and from a financial standpoint, it's fair given that you don't have to pay rent
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:26pm MST	Right? I'm just trying to justify $660 for like 3 days...
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:25pm MST	I'm not sure, but somehow I got the strange feeling that you wanted to do it and you wanted me to pressure you into it
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:24pm MST	*escort
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:18pm MST	He mostly just watches random YouTube videos.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:18pm MST	I need you guys to peer pressure me into spending an excessive amount of money to pay for his ticket here. @Jose @Paul @Daniel @Emanuel
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	I'm trying to improve his quality of life.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	Kinda like babyish but it's not restricted to age
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	You use it to describe someone who always wants to sit in their moms lap or wants to their boyfriend to fly across the country to spend the 4th of July with them
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:14pm MST	It's spanish
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:09pm MST	Chipilona
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 3:54pm MST	Same. Everyone from here's has been pretty nice.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 3:08pm MST	Awwww shit they're fucking dope aren't they?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 2:50pm MST	Philadelphia yo. It's in the very far south east corner.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:42am MST	Haven't checked it out
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:42am MST	I don't know
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:41am MST	Do they service and repair moons?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:40am MST	What is that?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:35am MST	This is my classiest dinner to date
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:00am MST	I try my best
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:40am MST	Yeah it's pretty dope to be fair. Lots of fresh produce, plus they sell like fresh pizza sandwiches and sushi, they're open 24 hours and they have like a 5 story parking garage on top of them.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:39am MST	Here's me climbing a fucking rock
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:37am MST	I'm sorry I'm living your dream and not appreciating it to the fullest
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:32am MST	I don't know why Facebook is trying to sell me cell culture, but I'm impressed.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:32am MST	That's amazing
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:32am MST	Also I've started seeing ads like this.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:31am MST	You're like a multi potent stem cell, you can be anything
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:30am MST	Oh shit. Your career path is so unpredictable Emanuel
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:28am MST	That's boring. You gotta get out.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:28am MST	This is my life at this very moment:
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 11:29am MST	Be true to yourself
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 11:29am MST	Well then I guess I shouldn't tell you how to live your life
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 9:42am MST	I just bought some dope ass soap from a farmers market
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 9:42am MST	Oh yeah that's where I live, in University City.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 8:05am MST	It's cray cray. I have to ride the bus for 30 stops, which takes approximately 27 minutes
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:59am MST	Send pictures if you see dope old buildings
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:59am MST	An area of downtown called old town
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:50am MST	Yeah it's cheaper but youre probably also at an early bird showing
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:49am MST	I'm very happy right now
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:49am MST	I came to a movie, all the seats are recliners
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:47am MST	Do you have Uber pool there?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:23am MST	Agreed. The weather is super nice though it's like low 70s and sprinkling occasionally
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:23am MST	Freaking extractions
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:22am MST	Yeah but there's literally no way I can finish my extractions in time if I can't get in this weekend. Then the plans are going to get all complicated.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:22am MST	It's a sign you should rest not work
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:20am MST	That wouldn't hurt Donald Trump much, his hands are so tiny
Jose Celaya	Friday, June 16, 2017 at 6:13am MST	@Olivia you're failing us
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 6:38pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 6:28pm MST	Holy shit. Best decision I've made this week.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 5:32pm MST	*any
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 5:30pm MST	Oh thank God I found a dive bar near my dorm
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 11:35am MST	Split screen af.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 8:12am MST	I also like this one
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 7:02am MST	I don't like the cropping though. Oh well.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 7:01am MST	I like that one
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 6:04am MST	No. I'm still listening to Discovery

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 2:22pm MST	Yesterday was 75% and same temp

Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 9:56am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 8:13am MST	Praise 2Chainz I finally got an email saying my web refund is processing.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 4:57am MST	#inspiredaf
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 8:09pm MST	ok, I'll do that tomorrow
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:37pm MST	Weird. Mine used to say my address but when I looked today, it was blank, so I had to update it.
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:34pm MST	nope, just the addresses
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:29pm MST	üçâ
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:25pm MST	thanks!
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:11pm MST	I think you'd have to call the administration building like Olivia
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 6:39pm MST	Hm, I don't think that's it. I signed up like a week or two before I got mine
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 4:37pm MST	Daniel did you have the same problem?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 4:37pm MST	Oh my god
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 4:05pm MST	Apparently at some point during April, a piece of mail from them got returned so they deleted my permanent address from my file, and they apparently can't process a web refund direct deposit without a permanent street address. So I just had to go on uaccess and update my address.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:57pm MST	Wow the u of a is so fucking g retarded.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:46pm MST	Sounds like a plan
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:43pm MST	Lol my phone bill and my credit card are both due like tomorrow.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	Ah. Well. It's amazing. I even own it on DVD so I can watch it for free whenever I want. Except it's at home lol
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	Not sure what I'll do yet, the night's still young
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	What about Amazon? I rent stuff on there sometimes.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:33pm MST	Damn I'm good.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:31pm MST	It has a VERY young Dave Chappelle. Like I'd be surprised if he was even like 20-21 in it.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:31pm MST	Seriously????? Watch Robin Hood Men in Tights. It's one of my favorite movies period.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:30pm MST	I don't know those
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:30pm MST	It's just my favorite Mel Brooks movie. I think Robin Hood Men in Tights is my favorite, but Young Frankenstein is a close 2nd
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:28pm MST	Seems reasonable I guess? I saw that movie when I was a kid but I only remember some parts here and there.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:22pm MST	Olivia you have to yell at/kill someone
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:21pm MST	I want to die
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:21pm MST	And all the hookah lounges close by are 21+
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:21pm MST	I might check out some places outside downtown during the weekend
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:21pm MST	Eh honestly it's like wet and dirty.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:19pm MST	Actually maybe February
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:18pm MST	We should all video chat together one day. It will be chaos.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 2:33pm MST	Whoa, yeah there's no subway here
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 2:29pm MST	I haven't ridden any of Penn's campus transit, I've just ridden the city buses, subways, and trolleys
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 1:31pm MST	But the seats are black
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 5:27am MST	You are a good child and the remainder of your summer will be blessed with good fortune.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 5:26am MST	You can't tell me how to live my life
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 5:23am MST	üçâ
Daniel Osorio	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:33pm MST	but will do and I'll inform you
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:17pm MST	No you already told me it showed there on may 25 remember
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:15pm MST	Holy shit
Daniel Osorio	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:15pm MST	I haven't received my marc money either
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:14pm MST	Oh
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:14pm MST	You're gonna have to teach them a lesson
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:13pm MST	I'd be scared to go near you at that point
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	One day, when I've reached my final form.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	Old grumpy lady
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	Go sleep Olivia
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	Ok then
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:09pm MST	That
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:09pm MST	Fuck that shit I gotta go to sleep soon
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:08pm MST	Help out Olivia, be a kindred spirit
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:08pm MST	I don't want their shitty brownies. My roommate who has never cooked a single meal in her life is the one trying to make them.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:07pm MST	It'll make up for it
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:06pm MST	https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ANrwekbVn2A0nVI&amp;cid=06FBEAF18D79E4B6&amp;id=6FBEAF18D79E4B6%21391637&amp;parId=6FBEAF18D79E4B6%21391477&amp;o=OneUp
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:02pm MST	Haha I forgot you had a blog
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:00pm MST	You gotta send more pictures
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:59pm MST	Basically
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:58pm MST	They showed is this thing called the v6 which is 3d. Each one of the quarters of the six screens is displayed by four projector‚Äãs
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:57pm MST	How many papers have you read?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:50pm MST	That's some hardcore shit
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:40pm MST	@Jose Celaya what stuff do you have to do?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:44pm MST	fuuuuck I have so much shit to do. This week is going to be hell.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:14pm MST	It's basically a bit bigger than the math department in ENR2
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:14pm MST	Oh ok that makes sense
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:14pm MST	Do you have a picture of your desk?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:13pm MST	Lol I meant same
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:11pm MST	Oh and Emanuel why'd you say sand?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	*papers
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	I've been reading so many prayers
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 2:56pm MST	So how was your very first day?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 2:51pm MST	Sand
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 11:55am MST	What do you mean? Im about to go meet with my PI ill be back
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 11:54am MST	100 hour weeks huh?
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 11:54am MST	Damn
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 7:04am MST	That's like page 2 of 30 of a packet I should read
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 7:04am MST	This helped wake me
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:09am MST	Jose I forgot I hope you're awake AF lol
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:42pm MST	Will do
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	But I have an idea
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	Have you never taken out the trash?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:40pm MST	I like in the name of garbage better
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	I'll keep you apprised
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:38pm MST	I'm gonna ask my lab tomorrow. They're all microbiologists like me. Plus one of them went to NAU and also lived in Phoenix, so I know he's also encountered different garbage.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:37pm MST	Olivia this has to become part of your research
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:37pm MST	That's true
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:36pm MST	But you said restaurant trash smells weird
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:36pm MST	But maybe it's the humidity difference, which could select for like different microbes and maybe molds, since I know mold tends to have a strong odor.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:35pm MST	The second is that there is something different. I don't think it's the contents because the individual dumpsters in both regions have a similar odor amongst each other, despite them likely having very different contents
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:33pm MST	I always thought trash was the same everywhere
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:32pm MST	Ok but you don't have anything to compare it to if you don't know what Tucson dumpsters smell like
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:32pm MST	The one downside of philly
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:30pm MST	I think I'll be good. I set like 5 alarms. Sorry about the question, I saw it late and wasn't sure if I should answer. But the answer is yeah, that's pretty weird. Why would all the trash smell the same?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:28pm MST	It's fine guys just ignore my question. Jose do you want a wake-up call or nah
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 5:08pm MST	So idk if this sounds really weird but the garbage here smells really fucking terrible. Like if I'm walking down an alley or dumping trash on the trash chute or even sitting too close to the trash in a restaurant it always smells the same idk what it is but it is distinctly different than any other garbage I've encountered.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	I'm excited
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	You're gonna be so good at adulting by the end of the summer.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	#momaf
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:15pm MST	Ok, I'm gonna be prepared as shit
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:14pm MST	Buy some drinks and stuff too, or better yet I recommend like the powder you mix in to drinks because remember you're gonna have to carry shit back with you. Small trips are better. Ask them to double bag your groceries, it'll make sure they don't tear while you're carrying them and if you want you can keep them and use them to carry your lunch with you to work then toss them when you're done.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:12pm MST	And in the meantime think about what you wanna do for breakfast and lunch during the week because you don't want to eat out every single day. So think of what you can pack in a lunch that you can make and bring with you (like sandwiches) or that you can take with you and heat up (like microwave meals) and write that shit down on a list before you go to the grocery store otherwise I can guarantee you will forget all the shit you need.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:09pm MST	Once I have a chance to talk to them
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:09pm MST	Ok but here's some shit someone in your apartment definitely want to get: Garbage bags Soap (dish and hand soap for the bathroom) Paper towels Toilet paper Hangers Ziploc bags Some Tupperware Aluminum foil Oven mitts Scissors Butter A dish rack (for drying dishes) Sponge Hand towels
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:06pm MST	Yeah that's true
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:05pm MST	Well we're all buying our own food
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:04pm MST	We just have to wash them
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:04pm MST	They came with the apartment
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:04pm MST	I believe so
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:04pm MST	Ok. Do you have a microwave, or pots and pans or anything like that
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:03pm MST	More than 5 items? ...no
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:01pm MST	But the quote's good enough to stand alone
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:00pm MST	There's no girl talking to you in this one
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:58pm MST	Yeah but not 4/5 stars from Mexicans....Who knows what the standards are.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:58pm MST	Unless you're scared it's a bad part of town you're living in
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:57pm MST	Idk about this
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:52pm MST	That was the only copy of that photo
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:50pm MST	It's like the girl is talking to me
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:50pm MST	Oh shit
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:48pm MST	Ok let me find it.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:48pm MST	Alright well since 3/4 of us (sorry Paul) are in our programs I'm gonna give y'all some daily wisdoms.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	Haha, I guess we're opposite
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	I've been going everywhere by myself, it's awesome.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	I feel weird being alone
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	Oh ok. Yeah my roommates are not very independent so they never want to go anywhere by themselves.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:46pm MST	But one is holed up studying for the mcat
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:46pm MST	By myself
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:46pm MST	By yourself or with your program
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:46pm MST	Well, at least your caught up now. And yep I'm in a diner called steak and shake rn
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:44pm MST	That's 6 am real time
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	We have the same time
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	Yep
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	Or est
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:40pm MST	I feel like the whole town is like a Wild West amusement park
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:40pm MST	Yeah I don't really like tombstone
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	Actually yeah that makes sense
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	Because people don't give a shit about horses in Tucson, they're everywhere.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:22pm MST	My roommates stumbled back around 2:30am last night, and I'm pretty sure one of them puked her guts out. Definitely don't wanna drink with them.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:20pm MST	Not with a bunch of screaming children who are outside of parental supervision for the first time in their lives. I don't drink with those kind of people in Tucson, definitely not about to start.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:20pm MST	Whoa
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:19pm MST	Like an adult.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:19pm MST	Yeah, we have one
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:15pm MST	You have a new group chat Emanuel?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:04pm MST	Pics or it never happened
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 1:44pm MST	But at least yours has a nice virw
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 1:43pm MST	This bed is bigger than my bed
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 9:27am MST	That's dope
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 9:24am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 9:20am MST	There's a real disk jockey scratching prince songs, and like 40-50 year old gay dudes sneaking chugs of vodka. It will be lit shortly haha
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:59am MST	I'm an hour behind you
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:56am MST	That could be a short novel
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:51am MST	Fuck if I know...Cindy said it should be coming. It showed up on uaccess on 6/6/17, but there's nada in my bank account. And Scott even checked the mail to see if they accidently sent a paper check. I'm so fucking poor üò£
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:50am MST	Yeah there's like a $10 minimum for credit cards so I had to get like the most super deluxe breakfast plate and I'm slowly dying.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:49am MST	It's entirely too much eggs. That's adorable. I wish I had a bowl to eat cereal out of.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:49am MST	I'm also eating breakfast
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:42am MST	Lmao no it's a local diner. Much tastier.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:42am MST	Is that dennys?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:42am MST	I was young and stupid back then
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:41am MST	I remembered that when I was there
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:40am MST	Guys I'm in Denver as fuck
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:05pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:00pm MST	*good
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:00pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:56pm MST	*Jose I will pray
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:51pm MST	Like one of the Mentor
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:51pm MST	There's some dude here that's a mechanical engineer
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:50pm MST	I don't know what grad programs there are for engineering. I think most engineers who go to grad school get an MBA for managing shit
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:49pm MST	I've considered that.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:46pm MST	I have the urge to learn how to weld. I think industrial engineer agrees with that.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:45pm MST	I have never heard of that.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:42pm MST	Lol do you mean more like an architect then? They build bridges.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	I don't wanna be a civil engineer
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	*I'd
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:37pm MST	I'm not sure. I feel like I should be able to build stuff
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:35pm MST	I'm considering some sort of engineering for grad school
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:33pm MST	What kind of engineering is Scott?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:30pm MST	I wouldn't mind going to grad school here
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:22pm MST	For my summer program, if you do well and get a recommendation from the program director and your PI, they'll recommend you for early admissions. Basically you'll submit a shortened grad school application. They'll give you a Skype interview in October, and if you get in you'll get an offer in November. But you still have until April 15th to make a decision, you can still go interview and visit other schools, but it's nice having an offer already in your pocket even before finishing your other applications.

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 12:59pm MST	I just think going to get him the morning of is a shit idea. That's like almost 5 hours of driving straight before the BBQ. When is memorial day/weekend, and are you guys free then?

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 12:16pm MST	Lame. I wanna get back early if possible cause I still gotta go shopping and clean the house for the BBQ.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 12:13pm MST	We could take my car or yours, I trust yours to be in working order compared to Jose's lol
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 12:10pm MST	@Emanuel I am your last hope. Unless @Paul or @Daniel wanna come with.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 12:02pm MST	Hey it's not my fault, blame Catholicism

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:37am MST	I don't have enough faith in your car Jose.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:36am MST	So I can drive part of the way?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:35am MST	Sounds good

Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:30am MST	The answer is yes
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:30am MST	Idk Jose, should I just skip physics entirely? We're not doing a lab and I already got the study guide
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:29am MST	Oh btw, when is later?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:29am MST	Yeah in one car

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:16am MST	It sounds way better than going to physics.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:15am MST	In fact, we should take a mini road trip
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:15am MST	Haha ok

Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:05am MST	I also volunteer to get you
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:03am MST	I mean, I think it costs like 40 bucks to some here and go back, so it kinda makes sense

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:41pm MST	Jose
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:40pm MST	Fuck
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:40pm MST	Wtd
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:40pm MST	Trying to find prom
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:40pm MST	Jose
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:36pm MST	Jose did you get in
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:30pm MST	Yes I assumed that
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:30pm MST	No just when you have sex.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:27pm MST	Damn
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:09pm MST	I look forward to your arrival.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:09pm MST	I'll be there in a little bit
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:07pm MST	@Jose Celaya My textbook says that it is estimated that the human mind cannot grasp the meaning of more than five alternating quantifiers
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:07pm MST	I take it you're not coming to the homework party
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:44am MST	Don't get me wrong, I am thankful none of y'all are knocked up. But I feel like if you were pregnant, we could all be rich and famous and wouldn't have to go to grad school.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:32am MST	Then we differ in opinion
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:28am MST	It's all to protect both of us.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:24am MST	I think I've gone over half of the total money spent on birth control
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 6:15pm MST	Same
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:36pm MST	Well your other finals
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	Nope.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	But just think of it as greatly needed resting time
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:33pm MST	I understand your death wish
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:33pm MST	And now I can't even justify the time I wasted playing.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:33pm MST	I hadn't saved the entire 3+ hours I was playing.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:32pm MST	This is too much reading. You're gonna have to tell me in person when you see me.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:31pm MST	And you would not fucking believe‚Äãwhat happens next.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:31pm MST	But he's sleeping. So she puts it in the fridge. Then he wakes up.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:31pm MST	Bring the ingredients back to the house. Ghost mom prepares the ambrosia. Puts it in the fridge, because the ghost dad was resurrected before the ghost mom, so he's aged further and he should eat the ambrosia first.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:29pm MST	So I have the scientist daughter go and fish for a shit load of alley catfish, then give it to the son who fishes for a shit load of angel fish.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:28pm MST	Now the death fish was a bitch. I started by having the oldest son read the lure book, turns out the deathfish only bites angelfish bait. Fuck I don't have any angelfish. Read the angelfish lure book. The angelfish like alley catfish bait.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:25pm MST	Then I need to collect the ingredients: one deathfish and one life fruit. These are items I have never seen before in the game so I look it up.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:23pm MST	Right??? And also it resets living sims back to the beginning of their current life stage. So basically I can make my sims immortal.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:23pm MST	Why don't you feed them ambrosia?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:22pm MST	So I start reading about sims ghosts online. Turns out there's a special food called ambrosia you can feed them to turn them back into people.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:22pm MST	And yeah ghosts shouldn't die
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:18pm MST	They do all the same shit except have jobs, so I basically just have them do housework and whatnot while everyone else is moving up in their careers. In fact the oldest son opted to adopt a baby, since the ghost grandparents are able to stay home and take care of him. So now baby Franklin is also in the house.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:14pm MST	So I guess I can tell you in the meantime.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:13pm MST	You heretic
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:12pm MST	Hey now.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:12pm MST	Thank Yeezy.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:12pm MST	Just ordered it
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:06pm MST	And ask yourself, should I order the corsage now? Or tomorrow morning?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:05pm MST	Read the first three rules Jose.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:03pm MST	I guess that one is ok.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:51pm MST	I still think it's weird
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:49pm MST	Lemme see
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:49pm MST	I could probably still acquire one
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:48pm MST	I didn't
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 12:02pm MST	Did you make that final your bitch??
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 11:44am MST	I made that final wish it was never written

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:46am MST	What did she say exactly??
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:45am MST	What kind of human being doesn't know what justified alignment is
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:43am MST	What now? I don't see any emails...
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:42am MST	Fuck that hoe

Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:55pm MST	I'll pray for you
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:53pm MST	No not a rattle snake. Just like a king snake or a corn snake or some shit.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:51pm MST	Idk. I mean I hear them at night but idk where they are. The only time I actually see them is on the power lines or flying at my car at night.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:50pm MST	Heyyyyy now we're getting creative.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:49pm MST	Hm that sound counter productive. Attract rodents to attract owls to eat the rodents.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:46pm MST	Lol how do you attract owls??? That sounds hardcore.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:35pm MST	That link isn't working for me. What does it say
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:35pm MST	Lol we already have owls, idk if they go in my yard but they're definitely in the neighborhood. I've seen them lots of times, and I hear them hooting most nights.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:34pm MST	Fuck butterflies. We need owls in your garden,

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:33pm MST	I set the trap in the garden by one of their mounds so I'll check in the morning if I caught any. But beyond that, there's poisons, snap traps, and gas.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:14pm MST	It's very nice to be a computer science and math major because we already have notation to type math
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:12pm MST	Looks like the only difference is that t' &gt; 0 everywhere but finitely many places instead of t' != 0 everywhere but finitely many places. And I guess that makes the absolute value bars go away. Makes sense, since in the first case t' could be negative almost everywhere.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:06pm MST	Let me see
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:05pm MST	@Jose
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:07am MST	Nevermind.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:03am MST	I usually eat it at my house. But I imagine I could make it at other peoples houses too.

Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 8:06am MST	They'd definitely find out at u of a
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 8:05am MST	I doubt they'd find out about pima
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:57pm MST	Basically it's just a little cup with a long spout that fits snug in your nostril and your pour warm water with salt and baking soda up your nostrils. It feels good afterwards because it soothes your raw nasal passages, but it also helps loosen any giant globs.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:54pm MST	No. Should i get one?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:54pm MST	Do you have a Netty pot?

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:35pm MST	It switched from one side to the other, or it started on one side but then both sides started hurting?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:33pm MST	And it's just on one side or both?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:31pm MST	Mine hurts like a motherfucker
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:31pm MST	Have you had an ear infection before?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 4:45pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 3:21pm MST	@Jose, are you gonna be working on analysis today?

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, April 19, 2017 at 11:13am MST	No, I couldn't go to the one on Monday because I was stuck in my lab. There's another one tomorrow, but I should probably go to physics..
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, April 19, 2017 at 11:13am MST	Don't hate you, just trying to study and y'all talk too much
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, April 19, 2017 at 11:12am MST	Sweet me too. You were right it's in 225.

Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:24am MST	You should write your paper on the ethics of killing dogs for research. And Paul should do it on giving mice cancer
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:23am MST	Yeah, its pretty amazing. But most stem cells are culuturable, just like my cells. So im using canine epithelial kidney cells, but its not like I have to go out and kill a dog, I just grow more cells.

Jose Celaya	Saturday, February 4, 2017 at 7:36am MST	I'm gonna spend too much money
Jose Celaya	Saturday, February 4, 2017 at 7:36am MST	Don't say these words to me
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, February 4, 2017 at 7:35am MST	Lol its more about frequency and money
Jose Celaya	Saturday, February 4, 2017 at 7:35am MST	Ok, I was gauging what a healthy number of times to go was
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, February 4, 2017 at 7:34am MST	Hmm she must be new ish, I dont remember a candy or a carly.

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, February 4, 2017 at 7:30am MST	That girl scares the fuck out of me
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, February 4, 2017 at 7:30am MST	And she has her tits and her lady bits all pierced
Jose Celaya	Saturday, February 4, 2017 at 7:30am MST	That would have freaked me out

Jose Celaya	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 8:02pm MST	I could be there in 40
Jose Celaya	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 7:54pm MST	You guys are barely going to the casino, and I really can't be out past 1, and if I wanted to drink I'd need like a couple hours to be good to drive. So we'd have to go to the club at like 10 at the latest.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 7:32pm MST	Youre telling me its like an hour from our place. Emanuel I just finished ill meet you downstairs
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 7:26pm MST	Holy shit that is far

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 7:01pm MST	Idk. I'll ask them when they get here. Olivia's doing some shit in her lab
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 7:00pm MST	I don't plan on gambling very much
Jose Celaya	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 6:59pm MST	Can I get in?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 6:54pm MST	No Daniel?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 6:02pm MST	So if we're gonna go, I need to not be sober lol

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 4:44pm MST	Paul do you remember when Olivia wanted to make sweet love to me in Florida?
Jose Celaya	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 3:32pm MST	Fucking gel, it was probably synthesizing a macro oxygen cleaving
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 3:21pm MST	I just got on the bus. Sorry guys my gel was being a piece of shit.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 3:17pm MST	Ok well maybe I could convince them to pour me a scotch, which doesn't require a bar tender
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 3:17pm MST	Peach mango are good together idk about mint, unless its by itself

Jose Celaya	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 1:26pm MST	Yeah, if you're around at 3 I'd be down to hang out for an hour.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 1:26pm MST	I knew for sure I wouldn't be done before then

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, February 2, 2017 at 12:24pm MST	This is like that time I was tipsy and tried to go with him to a review session
Jose Celaya	Thursday, February 2, 2017 at 12:23pm MST	Go!
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, February 2, 2017 at 12:23pm MST	I cant bail now it would be super awkward
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, February 2, 2017 at 12:16pm MST	Ahh, I see

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:40pm MST	üçâ

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 8:56pm MST	Its just off of cherry where all the construction is by umc

Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:16pm MST	Why do you have a thong?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:15pm MST	That's all you get to see for free
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:13pm MST	Guys I hadn't done laundry in so long that I had to wear my thong
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:09pm MST	I did nap today
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:08pm MST	Yeah fucking right
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 6:51pm MST	üçâ
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:59am MST	And no, were not being racist, it's a simple phonetic matter. James , Joey , and Jake are all phonetically identical in the begining. They don't sound like Juan, Julio , or Jose
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:57am MST	Jake, Joey, james, John those are the white ass names
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:57am MST	But we're not doing it cause he's white
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:57am MST	Yes
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:57am MST	It's cause he's new
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:56am MST	We're not saying the different names cause he's white
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:54am MST	The point is, we don't want Joey here
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:54am MST	His name is Jake
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:33am MST	Oh, that's another reason we can't invite John, he probably doesn't even believe in 2 chainz
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:31am MST	Except with science.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 9:16pm MST	This might take me a few days to think about
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 9:03pm MST	Hmmmmm im gonna think about this.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 9:02pm MST	Shit I gotta think about that. I mean Scott is always fidgeting with shit, which drives me up the fucking wall but thats not like a specific guy thing.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 9:01pm MST	Any of them you want to tell us.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	No wonder girls are always mad at guys
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:36pm MST	You know how if you eat a really big meal and it makes you really happy and sleepy and not care about responsibilities? Sex is the same way
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:11pm MST	I never said too many, just too much. Sex takes up a lot of time
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:10pm MST	That's not harsh, I think you're in a good place in your life if your problem is that too many girls want to have sex with you
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:09pm MST	Harsh
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:04pm MST	Why tho
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:37pm MST	Paul needs time to heal
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:19pm MST	He literally said hi im jake and thats it
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:15pm MST	Group chat is sacred
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:13pm MST	You guys are tearing this family apart
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:13pm MST	Paul doesn't have to open his heart if he doesn't want to
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 3:01pm MST	Dude I forgot. I gotta get ready for my presentation. If you guys can't get it answered I'll go tomorrow or Wednesday to try to get it answered.

Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:21am MST	I'd have to find some other source of food though. The more girls I'd knock up for milk, the more babies I'd have to feed
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:21am MST	I think thats basically the blot of the book of eli
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:20am MST	Now thats some fucking logic.

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:17am MST	Cows produce a shit load of milk compared to what a person could produce

Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:16am MST	Could you make dairy products from people?

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:50am MST	I dont get it. So do you?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:49am MST	I don't like the lion king, the lions are sentient beings that eat other sentient beings

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 11:22am MST	For the first time, I'm seeing the words &quot;President Trump&quot; on the news.
Jose Celaya	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 11:09am MST	I'd keep it, but then again I have an IPhone.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:42am MST	See Im the same, i loved my HTC but I've had it over 3 years...
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:37am MST	Scott had an edge, neither of us cared for it, but just because of the edge. The regular s7 is good. Im holding out for the note 8

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:34am MST	I would never support a system that intentionally removed the universal usb or the headphones jack, simple as thay
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:32am MST	The android system itself is the best I've ever used , but I really hate the different USB. I would basically have to carry my charger or an adaptor with me everywhere because no one else has type C

Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:47am MST	I'm at cactus grill
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:47am MST	PSU right?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:44am MST	I left the table to get food.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:38am MST	Yup that's what he's doing. I told him he's not doing anything wrong, she's the one that blatantly plagiarized, and risked his academic integrity in the process
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:17am MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:14am MST	I'll be there at 11:45
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:14am MST	I'm free now til 12:20 and 2-3:20
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:12am MST	*raises hand*
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:12am MST	Does anyone wanna eat at PSU later?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:12am MST	It's ok. I accept you.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:12am MST	Another freaking dilemma
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:12am MST	Damn, I'm racist
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:10am MST	That's racist
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:09am MST	That was it. We just have a lot of issues.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 10:59am MST	Here comes emanuel, bout to drop some wisdom on us
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 10:59am MST	We've had a lot of dilemmas lately.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:31am MST	But you can never get in trouble for turning in something plagiarized if you say &quot;this is plagiarized&quot;. Worst that can happen is getting a zero, but you said he wrote another version. So most likely his partner will get a zero/in trouble if anything
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:22am MST	And he thinks he'll get in trouble for turning in something that's plagiarized, even if he's only &quot;fake turning it in&quot;
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:19am MST	And she's like texting him and emailing asking if it's done and everything
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:17am MST	And now Scott is wigging out because he's supposed to turn in the paper at 2, but his partner is supposed to sign it before they turn it in saying what contribution she did.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:10am MST	Scott had to do 2 projects with a partner in one of his classes. He did all the drafting and calculations, she did all the writing. She sent him her part of the project on sunday, so Scott could add his drafts and print it.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 3:03pm MST	I think Emanuel read &quot;can't&quot;
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 3:01pm MST	I have left campus
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 12:32pm MST	üçâ
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 12:21pm MST	I'm finished at 3 so I'm probably going home
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 12:19pm MST	Do you know for how long?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 12:00pm MST	Gittings is a building on the east side of campus
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:43am MST	Gittings
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:43am MST	Donde?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:43am MST	3:30 Wednesday
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:42am MST	Has anyone told daniel? Also emanuel where and what time is your recital
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:35am MST	Exchange
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:35am MST	Oh a lighter note, are we doing total secret Santa or exchange secret Santa?
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:22am MST	Well if Cindy thinks we should be together, I guess I shouldn't fight it anymore
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:19am MST	Oh yeah, I just saw she was B and I was C and assumed. Dammit Cindy.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:18am MST	I would be first if this was alphabetical
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:17am MST	Jos√© you're presenting with your future wife
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:34pm MST	It's true.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:25pm MST	Text you tomorrow think
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:17pm MST	But yeah that's what I would do. Like it's way easier and less messy to switch projects than switch labs
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:16pm MST	Scott was asking me if I knew so I said I would ask you kids.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:14pm MST	I need a euphemism for &quot;I don't give a shit about this&quot;
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 1:42pm MST	I talked to Cindy, and she said it might be too late.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 1:33pm MST	What is it?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 1:30pm MST	üçâ

Jose Celaya	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 8:48am MST	It's not a dorm, it's where the agriculture dept is
Jose Celaya	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 8:48am MST	Across street from Gould-Simpson
Jose Celaya	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 8:47am MST	Building right next to yavapai
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 8:47am MST	Hey do y'all know where saguaro is? I think it might be a dorm?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 6:12pm MST	Uhhhh why do I have to get sick now I was soooo close to finishing the entire semester without getting sick at all
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 3:41pm MST	I'm good with that
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 2:58pm MST	When are we exchanging secret Santa gifts?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 9:42am MST	That's cool. I would offer recommendations but you probably wanna go to cool, hip bars, not dark dingy dive bars
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 9:29am MST	Holy fuck you guys are up early. Happy birthday fam
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 12:45pm MST	Well ill still be here for like 45 minutes

Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:07am MST	She*
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:03am MST	I mean applications of his knowledge to research, like I talked about computer vision as applied to the detection of cancer from MRI scans
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 10:58am MST	Guys my friend is applying to MARC, any tips for the application?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 28, 2016 at 11:13am MST	Emanuel's creepy picture

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, November 28, 2016 at 11:11am MST	A butthole
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 5:52pm MST	Ratchet
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 5:51pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 4:43pm MST	If I were a fish
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 11:26am MST	Emanuel are you seeing this wisdom
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 11:12am MST	What was it?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 10:10pm MST	The last sentence always feels awkward...
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 10:10pm MST	Ugh I have to write the last sentence of my paper.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:36pm MST	You could probably use other protein too like soy protein
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:25pm MST	You need bacteria to make cheese.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:25pm MST	Cheese never would have been born.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:10pm MST	I feel like he is
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:02pm MST	Microbes that are chill with people and not trying to kill them
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:57pm MST	Nah, I probably don't wanna work with infectious disease. I mean maybe. But very few people really get to work with the nasty shit like ebola or anthrax. And very few people work on smallpox anymore.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:52pm MST	Yup, or the NIH
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:51pm MST	Olivia, would you be down to work for the CDC?

Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 3:29pm MST	Why the fuck would you write a paper with 248 people
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 3:27pm MST	I wanna say two but that's my math instinct not my citation instinct
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 3:25pm MST	Any idea how you're supposed to reference a paper with 248 authors?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 3:24pm MST	Not even I wanna be that lit

Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 7:32pm MST	That's a good reason
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 7:31pm MST	I am also dying.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:51pm MST	I'm support this theory
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:51pm MST	100%
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:49pm MST	Dammit jose. I am old.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:49pm MST	But it blew my mind a couple weeks ago
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	He's said it like 27 times in the last five minutes.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	Wasting away
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	And I'm dying
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	My professor keeps saying tworque instead of torque
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:21pm MST	Will you still beat people up for me?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:09pm MST	Shit
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:09pm MST	Maybe if her face is all busted up you wouldn't like her as much
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:08pm MST	Damn just trying to help
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:08pm MST	Beat
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:08pm MST	Except Olivia, she just said she could bear her up
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:06pm MST	Fuck that hoe
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:06pm MST	You right
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:06pm MST	Donde esta la biblioteca
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 5:26pm MST	It sounds like maybe she just likes the attention
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:25pm MST	Oh you'd fuck her up easily lol
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:25pm MST	Do you want me to beat her ass?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:11pm MST	Moooommm it sucks

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:27pm MST	Yeah it sounds reasonable but I also know that I am not really a reasonable person usually
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:15pm MST	Positive.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:12pm MST	Especially since he supposedly did it as a gesture for me. And it's not just lie by omission, like he definitely went out of his way to conceal it from me, he just got a little sloppy and slipped up
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:10pm MST	I think your last point is very important
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:10pm MST	I realize quitting isn't easy and I'm not faulting him for that but I'm definitely faulting him for lying to me.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:07pm MST	And he quit as a birthday present for me like a year and a half ago, or so I thought
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 12:49pm MST	Yeah but I feel like I can live with that.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 12:49pm MST	If you snooped, you're 100% at fault for snooping.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 11:20pm MST	I believe you
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 5:17pm MST	I have that thought on a regular basis
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 4:47pm MST	Basically it's all about using bacteria, viruses, and parasites to treat diseases
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 4:45pm MST	What're you writing?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 3:57pm MST	I like Christmas
Jose Celaya	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 2:49pm MST	Listen to that little jumping...whatever it is
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 2:49pm MST	Lol its not the science. It's the writing.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 2:46pm MST	Ok that's definitely not making me more productive
Jose Celaya	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 2:45pm MST	I'm not ignoring
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 2:37pm MST	Damn. I was gonna say you should come to the library and inspire me
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 2:36pm MST	I am extrememly bored, but I'm not on campus

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 10:59am MST	Yeah buts it's all multiple choice, so I think it's safe to assume they all have the same point value, as individual points weren't listed for each question.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 10:42am MST	Because if they were worth 5pts each then 5x19=95 which isn't enough I figure right?

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 12, 2016 at 12:34pm MST	Lol yeah I don't think anybody does....but I could use help memorizing all 20 amino acids between now and Thursday, which you could probably help me with and it'll make you feel super smart in mcb lol
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 12, 2016 at 12:21pm MST	Ok but who's gonna help me study for biochem? Cause I am a whole new level of fucked in that class...
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 12, 2016 at 11:36am MST	Oh yeah do you just need help studying or do you not get something?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 12, 2016 at 11:22am MST	You guys are a bunch of bad influences. What do you need my brain for paul?

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 9, 2016 at 12:40pm MST	Too expensive, and way too extravagant.

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 8, 2016 at 12:56pm MST	Math has helped me get used to that
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 8, 2016 at 12:53pm MST	I don't understand what she said

Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, September 4, 2016 at 1:52pm MST	Guys I got so crossed yesterday
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 8:23pm MST	Viva M√©xico

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 6:04pm MST	With a rolled up newspaper, a dustpan, and a lot of panicking.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 1:37pm MST	How did you get rid of it?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 1:21pm MST	Scott found it, and dealt a critical blow, trapped it under a plunger and came and got me to get rid of it.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 1:14pm MST	That was in my bathroom last night
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 2, 2016 at 10:15am MST	Do you hate us now Olivia?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 2, 2016 at 10:13am MST	Not me. I'm stuck in my lab reading papers :(
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 2, 2016 at 10:12am MST	Also who is free between now and 2 pm?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 12:36pm MST	No I stayed in my lab 25 minutes late because science never runs on schedule
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 12:34pm MST	So did you miss the bus? Or did your subconscious lead you astray in the hopes that this very scenario would arise?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 12:33pm MST	Yeah it's coming. But I'm still gonna use it as an excuse to not go to my next class I think
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 30, 2016 at 8:05pm MST	I'm sorry I added insult to injury by spitting all over you
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 30, 2016 at 7:39pm MST	This is my life and I have accepted it.
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 29, 2016 at 2:57pm MST	Hey Olivia, where you at?

Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 26, 2016 at 9:14am MST	Do we have a MARC thing on Monday?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 3:00pm MST	ÛæÅî
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:54pm MST	My brilliance would be lost on them
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:52pm MST	Omfg
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:52pm MST	If they ask for specifics, just say you're looking at the effects of chromosomal ATP on the fluorescence of various messenger DNA structures
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:51pm MST	Haha I will.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:50pm MST	Just tell people you're curing cancer
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:50pm MST	Cellular and molecular medicine...I have no idea what I'm doing
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:49pm MST	Oh yeah well I have a lab again
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 5:29pm MST	You had to buy the blackberry?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 3:02pm MST	I'm on my way
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:35pm MST	You need a license to use the app because of some Bullshit software update. So it ends up costing a bit too
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:33pm MST	That's shitty. Is your professor using the app at all? It's cheaper than the clicker, if not free, I can't remember
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:30pm MST	Olivia what color is your clicker?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:21pm MST	Do you mean like upstairs? I've only been there like once...
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:20pm MST	I guess so...I mean I have a spot here in the cafe on one of the arm chairs I just don't know where everybody else is gonna sit lol
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:05pm MST	How dare you
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:02pm MST	But there's no pokestops there...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 1:53pm MST	This lecture hall is too big
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 9:42am MST	Anyone free before MARC class?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 3:09pm MST	So you've never gotten direct deposit for refunds?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 3:09pm MST	I get direct deposit for my job, but for some reason not this.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 3:08pm MST	Jos√© you do have direct deposit?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 2:57pm MST	Yeah. Same here. Now I'm just waiting in my refund.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 2:44pm MST	Guys, I just got my dough in the mail
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 1:34pm MST	I agree
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 12:34pm MST	I also have nothing.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 11:22am MST	I still have nothing.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 10:02am MST	C.R.E.A.M.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 10:02am MST	Got that dolla dolla bill yo
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:29pm MST	This place should be called the restaurant of the best Mexican food and margaritas. Not the little mill.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:28pm MST	Depends what kind of mill you're talking about
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:27pm MST	That's a dumb name. I don't even know what a mill does. Doesn't it make flour or something?
Daniel Osorio	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:18pm MST	I signed up for it but it was kind of late.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:11pm MST	Omg daniel is alive.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 2:34pm MST	She's contacting them. School starts Monday right?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 2:21pm MST	I asked Cindy about it
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 1:45pm MST	Still nothing.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 9:37pm MST	Me neither.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 9:27pm MST	I have not.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 9:18pm MST	Has anyone asked Cindy if she knows why we are being cursed to poverty?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 3:04pm MST	No, I asked Marissa, she also pronounces it incorrectly, I was talking about her
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 2:54pm MST	I said stuff about you marrying Marissa, then you brought up Olivia pronouncing &quot;gif&quot; incorrectly. Im missing the link between the two
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 2:45pm MST	*psst* Jos√©, Marissa may be more helpful than you know
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:21am MST	These financial aid motherfuckers
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:21am MST	Yeah everyone else that I know got theirs like Monday or Tuesday
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:12am MST	I don't remember them being this late last year.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:10am MST	Damn.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:09am MST	Lol can I put food on my bursars account?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 10:53am MST	No it doesn't cover dental I don't think. Emanuel isn't your orthodontist in Mexico anyway lol
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 4:28pm MST	Yeah Scott got his already
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 4:27pm MST	I have a friend who said that hers went through.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 2:14pm MST	I'm just using my powers of observation
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 2:14pm MST	Maybe not if you have a valid claim.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 2:12pm MST	Lol are you disagreeing with me?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:59pm MST	He doesn't know the hate that exists for him in the Facebook chat.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:45pm MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:44pm MST	That says a lot
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:39pm MST	The financial aid procrastinates more than we do.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:21pm MST	Me either
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:21pm MST	Nope, not yet I'm broke as fuck.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 7:05pm MST	Jos√© watch those handles
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	Only if you promise to introduce me to Aslan
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	Fuck yeah! But will you drive me all the way to narnia?
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	Cool. Now I can give you alcoholics a ride when you've had too much half and half
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:45pm MST	Not bad. A little expensive for the mileage, but not too bad.
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:43pm MST	A lot of miles
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:43pm MST	Manual or automatic?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:43pm MST	How many miles?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:42pm MST	I got to ride in Jose's car and you guys didn't.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:42pm MST	What kind though
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:08pm MST	Jose did I leave my jimmy johns box in your car?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 8:57am MST	*with
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 7:14pm MST	Y'all would have been proud of me, drinking entire shots
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:43pm MST	And calories apparently...
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:22pm MST	I would send you a gif, but I have shitty service right now.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:18pm MST	That song???
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:18pm MST	&quot;Lil stupid azz bitch I ain't fuckin wit chuuuuu...I don't give a fuck bitch I don't give a fuck&quot;
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:16pm MST	Is it no way Jose?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 11:35am MST	I did after the poster session, but I believe you said you were tired and going home. I haven't been sober enough to communicate with anyone since then....
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 7:56pm MST	I would send a thanks gif (hard g) but this wifi is not cooperating.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 7:49pm MST	I know it converges. I wanna know when it's pretty much converges. It's output from my simulation.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 7:28pm MST	I believe so. What is the series?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 5:58pm MST	And that tells me if it converges at all right?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 5:02pm MST	But you don't have a formula, just a series? Is it short?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 3:18pm MST	Does anyone know about testing to see if a series whose formula we don't know converges?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 2:34pm MST	Lol maybe I should teach her, I got it right away
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 2:34pm MST	It was so hard for me to explain this to my mom in spanish
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 7:27pm MST	I'm so sad. I came home, took a nap, then I was super looking forward to a bike ride...but I had a flat tire :(
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:39am MST	Shame on you
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:38am MST	I thought lunch was going to be at 11:30, not 10:30
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:37am MST	Jos√© you coming?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:33am MST	After I was the one that asked for lunch from first Ûæ∞ë
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:33am MST	Yeah we're here.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:32am MST	We thought you guys were sleeping...
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:31am MST	Not anymore
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:31am MST	Are you guys eating already?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:24am MST	Heading to cactus grill
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 9:14am MST	Ok, I'm by the gym north of the student union now
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 9:14am MST	After o print my poster, I'll head over there.

Jose Celaya	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	This can be arranged
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	I'm down
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:07pm MST	My lab told me to work on it over the weekend and print it in the morning
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:07pm MST	The guy who hates us
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:06pm MST	That's why I was asking
Jose Celaya	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 8:44pm MST	Anyone know how big the boards are that we're putting our posters on?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 6:35pm MST	How do you download stuff? Specifically, how do you download RAM?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 6:03pm MST	Lol
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 4:56pm MST	I don't remember
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 4:56pm MST	Lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 4:54pm MST	Olivia, how do you reflect images?

Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:29am MST	Ok I'm gonna start walking but it will take me like 20 minutes to get there lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:28am MST	I'm down.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:28am MST	Anyone on campus for lunch?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:41pm MST	I'm like old and shit, I could have broken a hip or something.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:25pm MST	It all happened so fast. Scott and I were riding to Agua Caliente to hatch our eggs and catch more poliwags, and we were riding into the park entrance.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:20pm MST	Lol how?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 6:53pm MST	Omg emanuel it finally fucking happened
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 4:32pm MST	Same
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 4:28pm MST	I'd be down, but I'm probably gonna have to work on my poster
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 3:44pm MST	Is anyone going to the mhd presentations tomorrow? I'm thinking about it so I wouldn't have to go to lab...
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 2:46pm MST	Did they shit on you again?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 2:45pm MST	I hate this poster more the more feedback I get.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 12:29pm MST	How much total did you spend for the glossy?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 11:08am MST	Got my poster printed guys. Dr. Tischler said it was EXCELLENT and gave me a smiley face
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:30pm MST	I have scholarship and only 7k in debt, but with MARC I'm gonna pay that debt odd
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:25pm MST	I don't have a scholarship. I also have more than 20K in debt üôÅ
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:21pm MST	Isn't pretty much everyone besides me on scholarship?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:18pm MST	Yeah so it would've been greedy for me to take any other help
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:17pm MST	Just wondering, because I declined all tuition help so that you guys could get more
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:15pm MST	Yeah
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:15pm MST	Did Cindy tell you guys how much tuition help youre getting from MARC?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:03pm MST	By an outlet?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:57pm MST	Next to it yeah
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:57pm MST	Are you guys still in between the three stops?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:55pm MST	If I need someone to be nice to me, I'll call him or my mom
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:47pm MST	Yeah, my mentor, the grand mentor
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:45pm MST	ÛæÅî
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:45pm MST	I have to get feedback on my poster from the Mentor
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	That doesn't say you have to label a part as the introduction
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	Hang on
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	I would really appreciate that
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	Do you want me to send a pic?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:25pm MST	I don't think it helps for my poster. Like half of it is intro and think it's dumb to have half of my poster in one box
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:25pm MST	I definitely feel like it helps
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:23pm MST	I think I have all of those parts. I don't think labeling them helps though
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:23pm MST	I was walking!

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:52am MST	Damn. I need more colorblind friends...
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:51am MST	He's kinda busy
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:47am MST	He said it's hard to distinguish between colors that are close to each other on the color spectrum, so colors far apart are good for them
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:43am MST	I am not
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:26am MST	Are you asking that cause you're working on your poster

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:24pm MST	I like waking up and working when I know everyone is sleeping. It makes me feel like Mike Tyson
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:19pm MST	When's your bed time?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:15pm MST	Fair enough, we actually like to keep the slut count down, it can get messy if there's too many
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:13pm MST	Most of the girls I know aren't very slutty, so not that high
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:09pm MST	Emanuel my friends are forcing me to ask this, what is the likelihood of you inviting slutty girls?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 7:38pm MST	But for real though, I was thinking basically anyone I can across. You guys are trying to make it big thing, yeah?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 7:34pm MST	We could promise to play work

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:30pm MST	This storm...we came home and there's no power, which means no Internet
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 26, 2016 at 12:30pm MST	I asked Cindy if I still have to send it in even though my lab is printing it and she said no
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, July 26, 2016 at 12:29pm MST	No, but do we have to email it to anyone just like the paper?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, July 26, 2016 at 12:28pm MST	Guys, do we turn in our posters tomorrow?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 26, 2016 at 10:23am MST	ÛæÅî

Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:49pm MST	I didn't even include a references section. I assumed that would come at the end, but now that I think about, that was not the right move.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:46pm MST	I like how he talked about it one and in my paper he wrote &quot;in our meeting I clearly said there was no reason to make these so inconsistent&quot;
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:20pm MST	He shat on my references section but didn't mark up too much otherwise

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 1:55pm MST	Where will you be ?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 1:44pm MST	Are you guys all in your labs? I'm almost done for the day and I still have like 3 hours to kill before our study group...
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 8:34pm MST	Thank you emanuel for voting.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 8:03pm MST	Option 1: Skip shooting so jose can come and we can still go up the mountain and do whatever. Option 2: Go shooting at 11, then pick up jose while Scott gets the grill going (it'll take some time to get the coals lit and everything anyways) Option 3: We do the barbecue one day and go shooting the other. Option 4: A different idea from one of you guys
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:59pm MST	Ok so the area that we go shooting is open, but the rocks and shit have shifted quite a bit since we last went. Basically it's kinda tricky to hike down to the ravine when you're carrying a bunch of guns and ammo and watermelons
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 6:38pm MST	Plus Scott and I haven't driven up there to see if it's open or not, sometimes it's closed because the fire risk is too high, so we don't even know for sure yet if we can
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 8:38pm MST	Just waiting for him and jose to fill out the damn survey.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 8:26pm MST	Just let me know what day works best so I can give everyone a ride there
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 2:12pm MST	There were those worksheets, I did one of them
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 1:28pm MST	Oh yeah. It's in China Olivia
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 1:26pm MST	Cool, thank you!!!
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 1:19pm MST	Hey when you guys registered for the gre, was the time 1:30 - 6:00 pm?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 12:24pm MST	I cannot find this room
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:56pm MST	I'm fine with Thursday
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:56pm MST	I think Thursday worked fine lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:32pm MST	Please don't have every possible hour in it like Paul's group
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:31pm MST	Any day works for me really. Maybe someone should just make a doodle poll already
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:31pm MST	How about Wednesday then?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:30pm MST	At least this Tuesday we do
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:29pm MST	To study? We still have tutoring..
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:28pm MST	I've done so much gre practice, except for the writing part. I'm in the top 500 on my app
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:23pm MST	Oh ok well I feel less terrible then. Cause I know I'm still not doing shit in my lab because I don't have all my training.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:20pm MST	Are you guys working on it tomorrow then giving it to your mentor like during the day or 1st thing in the morning?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:10pm MST	Lol
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:08pm MST	Anyways, will his absence affect your presentation?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:05pm MST	Psh yeah or just so you don't actually have to talk in front of the class. But our group literally only met once last Wednesday after class, we just did the PowerPoint on Google docs
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:04pm MST	Nope. We're doing a PowerPoint presentation with a crossword puzzle that the class has to do as we lecture.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:03pm MST	Recording / video of some kind
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:03pm MST	A recording????
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:21pm MST	Plus I though jose drives too? But if he really is 17 like his profile says then he's definitely not drinking at my place unfortunately Ûæ∞õ
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:14pm MST	I'll leave my kegs at home then
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 8:59pm MST	It's more of a brown unfortunately...
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 8:45pm MST	I mean I do have tiki torches...but I don't know about red carpet...I have some dirt?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 8:33am MST	If you don't wanna register with us, you can just tell us.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 8:28am MST	I appreciate that emanuel. Are you guys still in ILC?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 8:28am MST	I think Olivia is the one that hates us
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 8:27am MST	We will pray for you
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 8:17am MST	Are you alive Olivia?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 23, 2016 at 2:40pm MST	Well we'll all be together tomorrow morning so we can just figure it out then. I just didn't want Marisa or daniel to show up and none of us be there
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 23, 2016 at 2:29pm MST	Sweet cause I'm going home. Can you let daniel and Marissa know, like maybe shoot them an email
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 23, 2016 at 2:00pm MST	Plus I'm already done for the day in my lab....anyone?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 23, 2016 at 1:49pm MST	Do you guys just wanna reschedule for tomorrow? Since neither Paul or jose can go? Or still meet?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 22, 2016 at 3:21pm MST	Third floor by the elevator
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 22, 2016 at 2:56pm MST	Could you be more specific
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 22, 2016 at 2:56pm MST	Were here
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 22, 2016 at 12:41pm MST	Not sure what time I'll be done but if I can scoot out early I'll let you know
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 19, 2016 at 11:17pm MST	I agree
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 19, 2016 at 11:16pm MST	I sent him a friend request and he never accepted, so I guess he secretly hates us
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 19, 2016 at 9:00pm MST	I would add him, but I don't have him on Facebook
