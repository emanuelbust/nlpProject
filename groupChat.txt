Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 5:01pm MST	Jose I'm on my way, class was out like 20 minutes ago, but Christine kept talking to me

Jose Celaya	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 3:11pm MST	PSU?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 3:11pm MST	I'm down for wherever
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 3:11pm MST	Donde
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 3:11pm MST	Down
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 3:11pm MST	I'm gonna work on apps after class
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 3:10pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	Ok, maybe my email will remind her to send yours too.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	But if you haven't asked her yet I would
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	Cindy said she was gonna send me one this week, haven't gotten it yet
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	I just email Cindy?
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	Also, what was the deal with MARC letters?
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 3:08pm MST	Can confirm, here now
Daniel Osorio	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:57pm MST	I think today is the last one
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:50pm MST	Someone who is actually in the class
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:44pm MST	No.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:44pm MST	I'm really hoping someone says no
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:42pm MST	Do we have the MARC seminar today?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:22pm MST	*good
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:21pm MST	No most of them just want official scores and transcripts upon matriculation so you're goos
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:13pm MST	Think you're ok paul
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:09pm MST	Most my applications have just asked for the scores and my test number. They haven't asked for me to send them in officially. Is that bad?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:08pm MST	Agreed. Most of my applications say to send official scores but when I talked to their people at abrcms they said unofficial is fine
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:08pm MST	I could get so many burritos for 27 dollars
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:07pm MST	Who wants to spend 27$ for them to email a copy of my scores on their bullshit test
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:07pm MST	But mostly fuck ETS
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:07pm MST	Yeah fuck em
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:06pm MST	I think it'll be fine. If they're willing to reject someone who's super qualified because you didn't wanna throw away $10 for no good reason I say fuck them
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:06pm MST	So like probably I want to go to it the least
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:05pm MST	I only applied to it because my PI said I should apply to fancier schools in california and they gave me a fee waiver
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:03pm MST	I mean, how badly do you want to go to UCSF?
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:03pm MST	Basically I'm asking group permission to say fuck it and hope it works out
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	I'm semi over this whole application thing/haven't had enough coffee today/fuck this and I don't really feel making sure I did any of it right. If I did it wrong will they email me telling me to fix it you think or will they just not accept me?
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:01pm MST	Cause that defeats the whole purpose
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:01pm MST	Pretty much
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:00pm MST	Cause I saw that and thought it didn't make sense
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:00pm MST	Wait so if I scanned my unofficial transcript for UCSF instead of the official one will they hate me and not accept me
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:00pm MST	All I know is official transcripts are like $10 each or something and I am not about that kind of life
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:59pm MST	Yeah I remember it being something stupid like that
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:59pm MST	That one is stupid though, they want you to scan your official transcript
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:49pm MST	The only application I've seen so far that requires official transcripts is UCSF, the rest will take unofficial until you get accepted.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:48pm MST	Also yes, unofficial transcripts for applications. We can't upload official ones ourselves
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:47pm MST	Go through UAcces, academics, request official transcript, put in the address or destination
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:47pm MST	I'm 90% sure that's correct
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:46pm MST	I was supposed to put unofficial ones in my applications right, then I send the official ones through uaccess?
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:46pm MST	Can someone explain how the whole sending official transcrips thing works?
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:46pm MST	Exactly how I felt this morning
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:45pm MST	Fuck that's today?
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:19pm MST	üçâ
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:18pm MST	Si
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:18pm MST	Do we put the UA as our institution for UBRP?
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 8:06am MST	Fuckin UBRP
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 8:05am MST	@Jake @Paul @Daniel @Jose

Jose Celaya	Sunday, November 26, 2017 at 6:34pm MST	No, it sounds like more of an engineering program
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 26, 2017 at 6:33pm MST	Do you know anyone who knows it you think?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, November 26, 2017 at 6:33pm MST	I will pray for him
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 26, 2017 at 6:33pm MST	I don't think so, hes modeling his senior design project
Jose Celaya	Sunday, November 26, 2017 at 6:32pm MST	I probably won't be much help

Jose Celaya	Sunday, November 26, 2017 at 6:32pm MST	Is he solving a system of differential equations?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 26, 2017 at 6:31pm MST	Scott is trying to use it unsuccessfully.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, November 26, 2017 at 6:31pm MST	Oh shit
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 26, 2017 at 6:31pm MST	It's a finite element analysis program
Jose Celaya	Sunday, November 26, 2017 at 6:31pm MST	I think I've heard of it. But I forget what it is
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 26, 2017 at 6:30pm MST	Hey @Jose and @Emanuel ar either of you guys familiar with ANSIS?

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 12:51pm MST	Y'all still at cactus?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 12:07pm MST	Wow. This cattran is stopping to pick up a person in a wheelchair. Today of all days.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 12:06pm MST	Carpe the bowel
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 12:06pm MST	I'm down
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 12:02pm MST	We should go to cactus afterwards I'm starving.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 12:02pm MST	I appreciate your bowel control.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 12:01pm MST	It'll stay in long enough for you to get here
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 12:01pm MST	Just pretend you're at church or something.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 12:00pm MST	I'm on the purple bus I'm coming emanuel

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 11:57am MST	@Emanuel where do you want me to meet you
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 11:54am MST	How much time is there?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 11:54am MST	Omg I'm about to leave my lab
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 11:54am MST	@Olivia Gorushi a shit is coming
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 10:14am MST	@Jose did you forget to send it to Jake you monster
Jake Croft	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 10:09am MST	Thanks though!
Jake Croft	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 10:09am MST	In my defense, I have no idea what Google doc you're talking about
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 9:39am MST	If y'all had kept using that Google doc I had Jose make, our lives would be easier but alas.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 9:38am MST	Then ask Cindy for a letter saying I need a letter for x y and z school.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 9:38am MST	So what I would do is go through all of your apps to to figure out what they require, some say it on their website, some say it on the last page of the app, etc
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 9:37am MST	However all of the apps are different. Some you just have to say you're in MARC and that's enough, some you have to upload a letter, some you have to fill out a form signed by tischler.
Jake Croft	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 9:37am MST	So i should ask candy for it?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 9:36am MST	So Cindy should have a letter for all of us from Dr. Tischler just stating that we are in the MARC program, super generic not for any specific program
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 9:35am MST	I think you ask them and then Cindy. But I think for some of them you can upload the letter of participation? Then you'd just ask Cindy to email it to you. @Olivia can you confirm?
Jake Croft	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 9:34am MST	Wait so how do we do the fee waiver thing? Do we email them asking for one first and then have Cindy email them tje letter or do we talk to Cindy first?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 9:00am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 8:40am MST	Ok but can you abstain from pooping you think?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 8:39am MST	I'm free after 12
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 7:30am MST	I woke up with a shitty ass migraine, so I'm gonna go into my lab a little late, I just wanted to check and make sure what time you have class so I can drop off your anal beads.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 7:02am MST	@Emanuel what time do you have class today?
Jake Croft	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 8:49pm MST	üê≥
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 8:48pm MST	S√≠ se puede.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 8:48pm MST	No Jake we can do it.
Jake Croft	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 8:48pm MST	I'm only moderately fucked
Jake Croft	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 8:48pm MST	Sorry that's an exaggeration
Jake Croft	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 8:48pm MST	I'm soooo fucked
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 8:43pm MST	Ok well I was asking from a place of love, but I can see the hurt that I've caused.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 8:42pm MST	üçâ
Jake Croft	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 8:42pm MST	Ron gets it
Jake Croft	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 8:39pm MST	*triggered*
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 8:38pm MST	How are y'alls applications going?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 4:49pm MST	Ok that's what I thought I just wanted to make sure.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 4:48pm MST	No it just says year 1, 2, 3, etc
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 4:48pm MST	Previous spring
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 4:48pm MST	Are summer classes in the same year as the previous spring or the following fall?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 4:48pm MST	No summer option?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 4:47pm MST	Baylor wants my gpa and credits for each academic year, so I'm doing like academic year (fall and spring) but what do I do with summer classes?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 4:46pm MST	*question

Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 3:15pm MST	That means yes
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 3:11pm MST	Are you gonna sample Emanuel's poop to bring to your class?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 3:10pm MST	@Emanuel what do you think your poop forecast is looking like for the next 24 hours....any idea?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 2:56pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 1:23pm MST	Won't Scott be jealous
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 1:22pm MST	For the orphans then.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 1:17pm MST	If thats what it takes to collect a donation so be it
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 1:16pm MST	Are you trying to seduce me?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 1:16pm MST	Like 8 or 8:30? I can come by your dorm

Jose Celaya	Saturday, November 11, 2017 at 11:07am MST	Cool cool, so you think you'll be free to plant trees at 1?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, November 11, 2017 at 11:06am MST	Waiting for my laundry to finish. Then heading to my lab to do 5 min worth of work then wait for 6 hours so I was just gonna stay in that grad student office

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:43pm MST	It means Scott was whining but he has conceded. Little Anthony's has passed the house.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:43pm MST	What does that mean?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:42pm MST	Ugh. Negotiations are taking longer than I anticipated. House corruption and bipartisanship are threatening our freedom of democracy.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:41pm MST	Jose are you going to be ready to leave so that we arrive approximately at the same time
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:38pm MST	Don't we all
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:38pm MST	I feel like there must be a better way to facilitate democracy.
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:37pm MST	Because people read the phone book when they're filibustering, and that book is huge
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:36pm MST	I don't understand that reference.
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:36pm MST	You can read Dr. Mcevoy's groundbreaking text 'Biochemistry'
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:35pm MST	I'll filibuster if need be.
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:35pm MST	I hope we get the votes
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	I've already seconded your motion and it has been passed to the house of Scott for deliberation.
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:33pm MST	Then I move that we eat there
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:33pm MST	Probably not on University due to the game but little Anthony's sounds amazing.
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:32pm MST	Anthony's?
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:32pm MST	Illegal pete's? No anchovies?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:31pm MST	Also I'm wearing sweats so nowhere too fancy
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:31pm MST	Sooooooo more expensive than psu but ideally not that much
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:31pm MST	Um. I'm pretty sure all companies present are broke
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:29pm MST	How expensive on a scale from PSU to Yard House?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:29pm MST	And do you guys have any suggestions where to go?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:28pm MST	I'm down

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:27pm MST	@Emanuel what feelings do you have regarding dinner
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:27pm MST	Wait he's right there

Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:27pm MST	I'll do my very best
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:27pm MST	I'm going to plant one last tree. Can you attempt to get an answer from @Emanuel?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:26pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:26pm MST	Immensely
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:25pm MST	@Emanuel @Jose Brady and Scott want to know if we want to go out to eat before movie night. Are y'all down?

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 4:42pm MST	Idk I'm assuming on main campus somewhere.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 4:42pm MST	Oh I thought you were just being very formal and calling me usted.
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 4:42pm MST	Because there was no 's' at the end
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 4:42pm MST	I was asking where Emanuel was
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 4:41pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 4:41pm MST	I'm in that office by my lab
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 4:41pm MST	We can also stay longer I'm not in any rush I'm being productive af

Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 4:41pm MST	I'll be there in an hour. So we may not have much time. But I'm down tomorrow. Is Emanuel there?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 4:39pm MST	Come plant trees with me then
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 4:39pm MST	I gotta step up my tree game, I'm still planting plain trees
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 4:39pm MST	Hahaha
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 4:37pm MST	Porqu√©?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 4:37pm MST	Holy shit you guys I'm so pumped
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 3:04pm MST	I appreciate the prayers. May your trees be plentiful
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 3:03pm MST	@Jose gonna start planting üå≤ and bring productive af. I will pray for your safe arrival
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 2:54pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 2:53pm MST	Also there's tons of parking by your PI's office, it's actually closer just not in the shade
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 2:53pm MST	Shit, then I'll head over as soon as my mom gets back
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 2:51pm MST	So I just reparked in highland just to make sure I didn't get a ticket and highland is free, not sure if that will change or what but maybe just try parking there. It was basically empty too, I parked on the bottom floor.
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 2:35pm MST	Jeez, ok I might just meet you guys at your house then
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 2:08pm MST	Ok I'll be here until a little after 6, but FYI theres a basketball game so idk what parking is gonna be like. Idk if I need to repark before a certain time or if I'll get a ticket...
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	Gotta watch my sisters for a bit
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	I'll probably be over by 4:30-5 if you're gonna still be there
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 1:40pm MST	Jose I'm about to start my transfection which should take me ~30-40 minutes, then I'll be free to plant trees. Are you still coming?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 12:43pm MST	üçâ
Daniel Osorio	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 12:41pm MST	I still think the cheese is the main reason that I‚Äôm applying there
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 12:38pm MST	The guy from University of Wisconsin has resorted to beer and cheese to get me to apply.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 12:31pm MST	If I had to guess, I'd say we'll leave around 6
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 12:22pm MST	Jose read
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 12:22pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 12:22pm MST	Yes
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 12:21pm MST	Lol ok so you're going to walk but just not until later
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 12:19pm MST	I'll just go over when we're ready to go to your place. That way everyone does as little physical activity as possible.
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 12:19pm MST	When's movie night happening?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 12:10pm MST	But that seems silly lol
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 12:09pm MST	Yeah so if you want I could walk all the way to main campus, then we both come all the way back to change my media then drive to my place for movie night
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 12:03pm MST	That's so far
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 11:27am MST	@Emanuel I'm finally leaving my house #progress
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 10:56am MST	How do y'all feel about homework partying in the med student library? It's always pretty empty and quiet, lots of outlets, plus when we want a snacky snack we could go to the hospital cafeteria
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 10:47am MST	Yup. I'm eating breakfast now. After I eat I'm getting dressed and leaving. I have ~2 hours of lab work to do before my 4-6 hour break, so I'll keep you posted.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 10:44am MST	That is a vital part of hanging out.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 10:41am MST	I haven't exactly left yet.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 10:41am MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 10:41am MST	I'm down
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 10:23am MST	@Jose and @Emanuel you still wanna hang out and plant trees?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 9:58am MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 7:39am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 3:23am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 3:23am MST	Not dead
Jose Celaya	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 12:24am MST	Not yet
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 6:59pm MST	Are you dead
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 6:41pm MST	The scattered shards of my orb and I are on our way
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 6:33pm MST	Si
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 6:32pm MST	No I don't know where Paul and Emanuel are hurry up
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 6:31pm MST	Everyone there now?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 6:17pm MST	Agreed. @Emanuel your favorite person just got here.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 6:16pm MST	This is poorly executed.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 6:11pm MST	Paul just call Emanuel so y'all aren't confused.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 6:11pm MST	Sooo what up
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 6:07pm MST	Alright fuckk Jose. Where do you want me to meet you?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 6:07pm MST	Paul do you have an ETA?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 6:03pm MST	Goddamit, this code was supposed to behave. Yeah I guess Paul should take you
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 6:02pm MST	Emanuel I'll take you. Fuck Jose
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:57pm MST	@Jose why are you like this.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:55pm MST	@Emanuel make that 6:10
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:53pm MST	Scott and I are the only ones here so far don't worry Paul we won't order until everyone is here
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:52pm MST	Lol what do you want me to do? I'm not driving.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:52pm MST	It really be your own
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:52pm MST	Wow after i suggested this
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:49pm MST	Lol we'll save you a seat
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:49pm MST	I'm parked on Highland too
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:48pm MST	Wtf my class isnt over yet

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:42pm MST	Scott is making a bee line to these wings were already at speedway and campbell
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:42pm MST	@Jose Celaya
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:42pm MST	Can you meet up with Jose?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:42pm MST	Whoever is willlin g to give me a ride
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:41pm MST	Callate

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:41pm MST	@Emanuel who are you riding with?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:40pm MST	No Jose now
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:39pm MST	In about 15
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:39pm MST	Also who all is going so we can grab a table
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:39pm MST	Scott is outta class. Y'all heading out?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:30pm MST	Broadway and Rosemont. Best wings in town
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 5:30pm MST	Where is that?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 4:56pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 4:55pm MST	Approximately 6
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 4:53pm MST	When's that?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 4:53pm MST	Alright y'all wings over broadway when Paul and Scott get out of class.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:24pm MST	üçâ
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:22pm MST	I'm on Jose's side
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:21pm MST	How do y'all feel about grabbing wings? I could probably sell Scott on wings.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:10pm MST	And everything else
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:10pm MST	Even if I got 100 on this
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:10pm MST	I mean I'll try, I'm just not too concerned. An A is a 92% in this class, which I was never going to get
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	Nah
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	Jose do your fucking homework
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	I just calculated and I can get a 50 on this project and still get a B. So you can imagine how motivated I am right now
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:08pm MST	What about your assignment
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:08pm MST	If you are and you're going to yard house or thunder canyon or something of that sort I'd be down to go.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:07pm MST	We could.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:07pm MST	Are y'all gonna eat?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:07pm MST	He says he doesn't care, and him and I are carpooling. Too bad there's no tilted kilt anymore
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:06pm MST	That's also an option. Not much beer choice there though
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:01pm MST	I didn't know if we just wanted to go somewhere on University for the sake of convenience
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:00pm MST	Or anywhere else
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:00pm MST	I don't have a preference. We can go to pockets, yard House, thunder canyon
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:00pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 2:55pm MST	Scott says he doesn't know where we should go, do you have somewhere in mind?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 2:17pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 1:34pm MST	He said hes down after class
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 1:34pm MST	What did Scott say besides a grunt?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 1:23pm MST	@Paul
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 1:23pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 1:23pm MST	When are we getting beer
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 11:23am MST	Mi vida
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 11:21am MST	Olivia I don't think you'll ever be hydrated again
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 11:21am MST	Not on me
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 11:17am MST	Emanuel you got my water bottle?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 11:17am MST	Yep I'm here
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 11:17am MST	Same
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 11:17am MST	I just got out of class are you still there?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 10:50am MST	Grabbing something at cactus if anyone's around and hungry
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 10:21am MST	I read through it and he stopped and told me what to add. Asked if I had any concerns, he looked at my CV. I have to make the changes and send them to him and he'll give me an A in the class
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 10:19am MST	Jose what did he say?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 7:11am MST	Disappoint indeed
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 7:11am MST	Ok well I'll meet with you at some point today
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 7:11am MST	I have an eight a.m.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 7:11am MST	Disappoint....
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 7:10am MST	I go to class at 9:30-1:20 lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 7:09am MST	I also shit and what ti me olivia
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 7:09am MST	That would be really cool
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 7:09am MST	*oh shit
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 7:09am MST	I shit
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 7:09am MST	@Jose do you think this is true?????????????
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 7:02am MST	Emanuel can I get my water bottle from you sometime today? Preferably in the morning
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 7:01am MST	Shiiiiiit
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 7:01am MST	I believe in you Jose.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 7:01am MST	#woke
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 7:01am MST	#boozehasarrived
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 7:00am MST	#awakeaf
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 7:00am MST	@Jose wake up
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:37pm MST	You might as well put it on your grad school apps
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:37pm MST	Ok buenas noches finish your assignment. It will never die.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:36pm MST	That hashtag better die down though
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:36pm MST	Lol
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:36pm MST	I tried putting &quot;Wake Jose the fuck up&quot; but it was too long
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:35pm MST	Goddamit
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:34pm MST	7am is for you fam.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:32pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:32pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:32pm MST	I'll probably be able to get up by 7. So whenever you get up is good, it'll be like a backup in case I'm stupid and don't wake up
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:31pm MST	What time
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:31pm MST	That would be good
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:30pm MST	Do you want me to wake you up. I'm getting up around 7
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:30pm MST	Good to know, I'll be early
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:30pm MST	Oh shit
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:30pm MST	Just don't be late and you'll be fine. He's really nice and he'll tell it how it is but he fucking hates tardiness more than like anyone you know.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:29pm MST	Lol, I'll be sure to do it just like that
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:28pm MST	Ok well here's my advice:
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:28pm MST	I believe tomorrow at 9
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 10:21pm MST	@Jose are you meeting with my uncle soon
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:41pm MST	Officially finished my Princeton personal statement.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:04pm MST	Then I think it's perfect
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:04pm MST	Yeah but the PIs are pretty much all wet lab people
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:04pm MST	That's very true. You'd sound kinda silly if you were writing for a bunch of computer scientists
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:03pm MST	People who know how to code don't say that though.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:02pm MST	Lol
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:02pm MST	That's what tischler made me do when I said I used python
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:02pm MST	Ok. And I might as well speficiy the programming language R.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:02pm MST	Lol
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:02pm MST	I mean either word takes an effort for me so
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:01pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:01pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:01pm MST	Ok. So statistical then?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:01pm MST	It sounds like you made an effort to use it
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:01pm MST	This is also true for me
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:01pm MST	That I wouldn't use that word if it is indeed a word
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:00pm MST	What that it's not a word?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:00pm MST	I concur with Jose
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:00pm MST	I mean word is ok with it
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:59pm MST	I may be wrong
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:59pm MST	I don't think that's a word
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:58pm MST	Y'all should get on the same page. Why statistical and not bioinformatic?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:57pm MST	I wouldn't change anything. The people who're reading probably know R.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:57pm MST	Ok. And @Emanuel you concur?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:56pm MST	&quot;Performed statistical analysis of 16S gene sequencing data using the programming language R&quot;
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:56pm MST	Apparently he is not familiar with R
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:56pm MST	Ok somebody just tell me what to write
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:56pm MST	Lol that's a good question
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:55pm MST	Or just &quot;statistical analysis, or analysis of data from, ...&quot; etc
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:55pm MST	Does he know what r is?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:55pm MST	That sounds good
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:55pm MST	So should I say &quot;...gene sequencing using the R programming language&quot; or what do i say
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:55pm MST	I would drop bioinformatic
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:54pm MST	So I guess I should clarify what r is
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:54pm MST	)
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:54pm MST	And I wrote &quot;bioinformatic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing using R&quot; and Dr. Tischler wrote a note saying (? - what is this?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:54pm MST	Makes sense
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:53pm MST	So I'm trying to write in my personal statement all of the skills I learned over the summer
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:51pm MST	Qu√© onda
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:39pm MST	Hey @Emanuel and/or @Jose I have a question
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 7:06pm MST	I mean I asked him while he was doing homework and he sorted of grunted. I think that means yes, I've never seen him turn down beers before.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 6:13pm MST	Tell him about beer tho
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 4:50pm MST	I'mma take a nappy nap then I'm gonna plant trees with you guys long distance.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	üçâ
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 4:14pm MST	Olivia tell Scott we should get beers tomorrow
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 3:07pm MST	I'm coming back momentarily.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 2:45pm MST	Finders keepers
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 2:34pm MST	@Emanuel my water bottle!!!!!
Jake Croft	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 12:48pm MST	Also I approve of the twin peaks gif emanuel
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 12:47pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 12:44pm MST	Unfortunately yes
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 12:43pm MST	Did someone explain #boozehasarrived to Emanuel?

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, October 28, 2017 at 10:45pm MST	I found out keylimes aren't actually ripe when they're green, they're yellow

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 6:57pm MST	RIP
Jose Celaya	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 6:57pm MST	The unfortunate and sad answer to that question is yes
Jose Celaya	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 6:56pm MST	I appreciate the spiritual support
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 6:56pm MST	@Jose Celaya are yoou still doi ng hw?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 6:02pm MST	Sorry I had already left when I got this Jose. But I am being productive af at home, so I am homework partying with you in spirit.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:27pm MST	Gonna be homeworking for the foreseeable future if anyone wants to join
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:15pm MST	sure, I‚Äôll let you know
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:14pm MST	oh ok. Well whenever you go next, I can come help you if you want. It could be something small just with how you're inoculating it or something.
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:14pm MST	I went to my lab this morning
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:13pm MST	I‚Äôm in the science library
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:12pm MST	are you in your lab now? I just got out of class.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:11pm MST	no it shouldn't matter, they're just different types of nutrients. E. coli grows in everything.
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:10pm MST	do you think the liquid media shoul be the same as the solid one?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:10pm MST	weird. Maybe your media is bad? when are you gonna try it next, I could come supervise lol
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	yep, I‚Äôve repeated everything like 5 times now
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:07pm MST	You're sure the lids are loose right? 37 degrees Celsius? Overnight with shaking?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:07pm MST	Hmmmmm. I mean e. Coli grows in pretty much everything. What concentration is your antibiotic? Maybe it's too strong....
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:07pm MST	supposed*
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:07pm MST	because all of them are supposes to have the plasmid with the resistance gene
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:06pm MST	yes, that‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs weird that they‚Äôre not growing when I move them to liquid media
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:06pm MST	What about your plate, did that have kanamycin?
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:05pm MST	I made the plasmid map some weeks ago
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:05pm MST	yeah I was joking a little, the plasmid do have the kanamycin resistance gene
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:02pm MST	Do you know the name of the gene from the company? You can look it up to double check.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:02pm MST	Lol that would be good. You don't have a plasmid map, it's like a picture that shows the different genes and what order they are in on the plasmid?
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 3:01pm MST	Hopefully the same as the antibiotic I‚Äôm using
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 2:59pm MST	And what antibiotic resistant gene is in your plasmid?
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 2:58pm MST	Yes, they‚Äôre transformed bacteria
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 2:57pm MST	kanamycin
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 2:44pm MST	Lol ok what antibiotic are you using? Is it ecoli with a plasmid or something?
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 2:42pm MST	Yes, that‚Äôs what the 100 year-old book I‚Äôm using tells me to do
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 2:41pm MST	Weird. Are you using antibiotics or anything?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 2:28pm MST	I've never heard of terrific broth. Let me look it up
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 2:20pm MST	yes, they're incubated in a shaker overnight with looselids
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 2:19pm MST	I'm using terrific broth (TB)
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 2:15pm MST	Do you mean LB? Are they being incubated in a shaker? With loose lids?
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 2:14pm MST	colonies from agar plates to liquid TB media
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 1:37pm MST	Ok in liquid culture or on an agar plate?
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 1:35pm MST	e. coli
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 12:56pm MST	Lol what kind?
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, October 12, 2017 at 11:23am MST	and you know microbiology

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	But then on your talk at the Indiana reu conference (which doesn't exist btw I looked up the real name) you wrote poster presentation/talk
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	Did you say something different?
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 3:41pm MST	Yeah
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 3:41pm MST	Well on most of them you wrote poster presentation.

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 3:27pm MST	@Jose
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 3:27pm MST	Jose what does poster presentation/talk mean
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 2:32pm MST	Ok
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 2:32pm MST	üòë
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 2:31pm MST	And yeah if you could that would be great
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 2:31pm MST	I'm sorry wasn't sure if you even remembered
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 2:31pm MST	Ok so you want me to format it nicely then
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 2:31pm MST	Ugh why didn't you tell me....
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 2:30pm MST	I sent it to him already, but I'm cool if you make it look nicer, just in case he hates it again and even if not I know I should word some things better
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 2:28pm MST	Jose I'm fixing your CV. Your formatting is all fucking weird Im just gonna move your info into a new doc
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 2:26pm MST	I'll email him then
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 1:55pm MST	Paul yeah he told me he'd give me full points on the cv and paragraph if I resubmit. Talk to him because it'd be shitty if it affected your gpa
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 1:20pm MST	I would just go to his office hours or email him or something and ask if you can submit a revision
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 1:18pm MST	Didn't have
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 1:17pm MST	Well that lady made it seem like we had a choice
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 1:17pm MST	I didn't use that shitty template
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 1:17pm MST	He said stuff about spacing and technical things. It was that template that fucked me. Didn't say anything about resubmittion though
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 1:14pm MST	Does it say why though
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 1:13pm MST	Also got a 50 on my CV
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 1:12pm MST	You should open it and see if it says that
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 1:12pm MST	Yeah but Jose got a zero on his CV, but then the comments on the document said he could resubmit it
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 1:11pm MST	Getting a zero obviously means I'm not getting an A, so I don't want to affect my GPA with this
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 1:10pm MST	I doubt it but you can ask Cindy I guess
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 1:07pm MST	Can we audit this class?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 1:07pm MST	Idk I haven't looked at the comments yet
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 1:00pm MST	Did he say what you guys did?

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 22, 2017 at 12:57pm MST	What did you guys do???

Daniel Osorio	Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 9:27pm MST	no, just a powerpoint slide with the assignment on it
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 9:07pm MST	I don't remember very much homework in that class...is it like a paper or something?
Daniel Osorio	Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 9:05pm MST	@Olivia Gorushi a friend is taking biotechnology and says he's having trouble with a homework; I think they have to make a restriction library. Do you remember that assignment?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 7:54pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 7:54pm MST	lol
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 7:53pm MST	But I'm not salty about analysis at all...
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 7:53pm MST	And I'm not sure...probably something like &quot;why do we define continuity with epsilon and deltas when the sequence definition is equivalent and 1000 times more understandable???&quot;
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 7:53pm MST	Nah
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 7:52pm MST	Lol, is this the question you'd ask?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 7:51pm MST	@Jose Celaya if you could ask all of the math majors one question, what would it be?

Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 2:45pm MST	Is Jake pitching in too? If not 11 per person should cover the 65. If he is then 10 should be more than enough

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 6:00pm MST	Yeah but if you look under grades they're both weighted as 5%...idk as long as it's not just me
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 5:58pm MST	Assignment did say they were worth 10 point combined. And I have a 10/10 on the letter. I think they just didn't bother to combine them
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 5:58pm MST	And I thought so. I couldn't figure out how to plot them without values
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 5:57pm MST	Same no grade on memo
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 5:49pm MST	@Paul scott says he didn't do part c because there's no way to plot it without making up values for the constants
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 5:48pm MST	Same only on letter
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 5:47pm MST	Hey did you guys get grades for both the letter of rec and the memo? I got feedback on both but no grade on the memo, just the letter.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 5:45pm MST	Yeah sorry I forgot I'll ask him now
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 3:55pm MST	Olivia can you ask Scott tonight what he did for the code for #4?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 12:53pm MST	I'm in the science and engineering library now... On a quiet floor
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 12:45pm MST	How long will you be there?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 12:20pm MST	I have to code a stupid OS project with my partner
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 12:19pm MST	I'm going to cactus to eat and study for my exam at 3 if anyone is free
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 10:10am MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 9:59am MST	All of it
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 11, 2017 at 10:07pm MST	Jose guess how much of my communications homework I've done.
Jose Celaya	Monday, September 11, 2017 at 8:55pm MST	@Emanuel if you're still up, i got 0.0062 for part a of 42, and [13.43,14.57] for part b
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 11, 2017 at 7:01pm MST	I will take your word for it
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, September 11, 2017 at 6:57pm MST	Thanks. I was just confused by the lack of radius, center of gravity, and weight variables
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 11, 2017 at 6:49pm MST	I have no idea what this means, and Scott says no guarantees.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 11, 2017 at 6:45pm MST	Sorry I'm making dinner. He just started it a few minutes ago though
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 11, 2017 at 5:49pm MST	Yeah hold on I just got home
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, September 11, 2017 at 5:37pm MST	Olivia can you ask Scott how he did 2a on the hw for 466? I think I'm overcomplicating the shit out of it
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, September 11, 2017 at 5:01pm MST	Jose is going
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, September 11, 2017 at 5:00pm MST	PSU
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, September 11, 2017 at 4:59pm MST	Emanuel where are you?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 11, 2017 at 3:56pm MST	I will pray for you guys
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, September 11, 2017 at 3:01pm MST	Me and jose are gonna be at psu
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, September 11, 2017 at 2:03pm MST	And also need to go over my presentation
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, September 11, 2017 at 2:03pm MST	I'm free
Jose Celaya	Monday, September 11, 2017 at 7:25am MST	Damn. Yeah I'm only free 1-2 and 3-4. Anyone else?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 11, 2017 at 7:22am MST	I'm free 2-3 but that's it
Jose Celaya	Monday, September 11, 2017 at 7:07am MST	Anyone free at 3? Kinda wanna go over my presentation.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, September 10, 2017 at 9:35pm MST	Lol sounds good
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, September 10, 2017 at 8:58pm MST	I don't know how I sent that, but I'm down with 5
Jose Celaya	Sunday, September 10, 2017 at 8:52pm MST	Down. I'm free for a couple of 1 hour blocks. Would you be ok with like 5?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, September 10, 2017 at 7:05pm MST	@Jose we should meet up to do stats tomorrow
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, September 10, 2017 at 11:42am MST	Did you guys buy me a sword?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 11:05pm MST	@Emanuel
Jose Celaya	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:59pm MST	@Emanuel you're missing out
Jose Celaya	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:35pm MST	Same
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:28pm MST	We've arrived.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:08pm MST	Ok.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:08pm MST	Cool, I'll be there in 28 mins
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:07pm MST	How about the in n out at kino and ajo? It's right off i10
Jose Celaya	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:06pm MST	Sure, where's a good place?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:04pm MST	Do you wanna meet up somewhere and you can ride with us? Parking is a bitch there.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:04pm MST	Fuck why not, I'll be there in 30
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:04pm MST	*away
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:04pm MST	Almost out of Narnia, still a ways aeay
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:03pm MST	Pretty fucking far lol
Jose Celaya	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:03pm MST	How far are you from it?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:03pm MST	We are on our way now
Jose Celaya	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:03pm MST	Oh shit
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:03pm MST	Fucking yes
Jose Celaya	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:03pm MST	You all going?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:03pm MST	You could have a part in the festivities
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:03pm MST	On our way now.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 8:02pm MST	Did y'all end up going?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 9, 2017 at 7:15pm MST	Anyone wanna go to the swap meet with us right now???
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 11:15pm MST	No transportation is stupid why are they closed all weekend
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 11:15pm MST	Agh
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 11:15pm MST	Not that you're stupid
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 11:15pm MST	Yeah. Jeez that's stupid
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 11:14pm MST	I'm pretty sure I left them on the cat tran
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 11:14pm MST	I dont think so, I definitely wasn't holding them when I left peiwei
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 11:14pm MST	I mean I didn't sit down or order or do anything inside
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 11:14pm MST	I meant maybe they fell outside like under the table
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 11:13pm MST	I didn't go inside the hookah lounge at all
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 11:13pm MST	You looked at the hookah lounge?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 11:13pm MST	But I thought Scott had my spare but he can't find it
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 11:12pm MST	No they're gone until Monday
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 11:12pm MST	Lost and found said they don't have it?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 11:11pm MST	I can't find it üò≠üò≠üò≠
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 11:11pm MST	Same here
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 11:11pm MST	Nope sorry
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 11:10pm MST	@Jose? @Paul?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 11:09pm MST	Hey guys I know this is a long shot but I didn't give any of you my spare car key did I???
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 9:13pm MST	I just ate.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 8:38pm MST	How about now
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 7:56pm MST	I can't guys. I'm already at a restraraunt
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 7:52pm MST	Eat with us
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 7:52pm MST	I'm eating right now.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 7:47pm MST	@Emanuel
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 7:46pm MST	@Emanuel you around?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:40pm MST	Fucking piece of shit messenger got rid of my asterisks
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:39pm MST	*queue we are your friends speech*
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:39pm MST	We're not even friends
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:39pm MST	Wow
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:39pm MST	I'm meeting a friend
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:38pm MST	For what
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:38pm MST	I have to be here at 5:45, so I think we a should do something close
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:37pm MST	What would you like to do
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:37pm MST	So we're deciding what to do
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:37pm MST	Lol
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:37pm MST	then I can hang out for 4-6 hours
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:37pm MST	I have to go to my lab for 45 minutes
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:36pm MST	I'm on the quiet floor of the library
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 4:36pm MST	Message me
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:47pm MST	I have no clue. I don't have time to print though. I'm barely gonna make it on time
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:42pm MST	Emanuel are you observing this shit.
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:41pm MST	Paul can you confirm?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:41pm MST	Lol
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:41pm MST	Yeah I know, I think he said that though
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:40pm MST	It's because we're gonna peer review
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:40pm MST	I don't remember that but maybe
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:38pm MST	I think he said we could bring our Computer though
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:38pm MST	Fuck
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:37pm MST	Don't forget you gotta bring a hard copy to class
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:35pm MST	Same
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:33pm MST	Finishing this horrible fucking memo
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:28pm MST	Just parked in sixth. Where y'all at
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:12pm MST	I did top two
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:11pm MST	But like every potential mentor for each one?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:11pm MST	I included mine
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:01pm MST	?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 2:01pm MST	Does the memo have to include all the graduate school info already
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 1:49pm MST	Not yet I didn't go to my lab today so I'm about to head to campus now
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 1:49pm MST	@Olivia Gorushi are you HW partying right now ?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 1:31pm MST	Mine is shitty lol. Cranked it out in 30 minutes üòÖ
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 1:22pm MST	I would accept the shit out of myself.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 8, 2017 at 1:22pm MST	Holy shit you guys my letter is dope af
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 10:09pm MST	The first step is admitting you have a problem Olivia
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:43pm MST	Yeah actually that's what it looks like
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:42pm MST	Would I just change the centered difference equation to the forward difference equation?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:42pm MST	üçâ
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:41pm MST	I think I need the for loop
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:41pm MST	Forgot h is changing
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:41pm MST	Didn't read the whole thing
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:41pm MST	No don't listen to me
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:40pm MST	I don't think so. Might be wrong. Don't you just have to do (f(1)-f(0.5))/0.5?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:38pm MST	You're saying for loop wouldn't be necessary?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:34pm MST	Ok, so wouldn't it just be a small calculation. No loop?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:30pm MST	It's just using x _i+1 instead of x_i-1
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:29pm MST	It does
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:29pm MST	Example 4.4 helps
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:25pm MST	Let me take a look
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:24pm MST	Me neither. I looked at the equation but it doesn't make much sense to me
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:23pm MST	Hm I'm actually not sure what forward divided difference
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:20pm MST	Did you get a look at 23?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:16pm MST	Yeah I do that often, at least matlab tells you when you don't use something
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:15pm MST	Ignore the prev_app that wasn't needed
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:11pm MST	Yep that looks like it works
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:10pm MST	Does this make sense ?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:47pm MST	Nope, since you don't have a criterion and you just have to do the first 4 and print the error
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:46pm MST	I wouldn't need the while loop anymore right?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:42pm MST	Yep, I saw that too. That'll work, and it'll just be a small modification of the sin and cos code.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:42pm MST	I was basing mine on that
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:39pm MST	Yeah no problem ignore it what you said works
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:39pm MST	Yeah actually that would give the same result
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:39pm MST	Ok that website just confused me lol
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:38pm MST	Since it's f(2) I would use ln(1+1)
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:38pm MST	That website makes sense to me
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:38pm MST	http://math2.org/math/expansion/log.htm
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:37pm MST	Let me double check
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:37pm MST	Yeah that's what I saw when I looked up the expansion
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:36pm MST	For 15, would I use the Taylor expansion for ln(1+X)?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:25pm MST	Yep, just change the 2i to 2i + 1 in the factorial and exponent
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:24pm MST	Yeah it makes sense. I'm trying to change the cos to sin right now
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:24pm MST	*were
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:24pm MST	We're you able to run it?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:21pm MST	And then terminates when the approximate error is less than the criteriom
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:21pm MST	Calculating the errors at each step
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:20pm MST	Then the loop in the main function goes through each order
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:20pm MST	Does the function make sense? You pass in the value you want to put in the cos, and the order of the approximation.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:18pm MST	Yeah you have a (-1)^i term. You see it in the cos_app function?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:18pm MST	Jose one of the things I was confused about on 12 was how to do the alternating sign
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 7:04pm MST	Oh that &amp;&amp; order &lt; 20 should not be there.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 7:03pm MST	Oh I didn't know you had MATLAB
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:58pm MST	Matlab right?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:58pm MST	What language?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:58pm MST	And I accidentally did 12 for cos but you can change it
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:57pm MST	Ok, well 4.15 should be easier than 4.12. I'll show you what I got for 12 and then I'm sure you'll be able to do 15
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:56pm MST	The others I'm just pretty lost on. I haven't coded in anything that's not image analysis in a while
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:51pm MST	What's weird with them?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:51pm MST	Ok, figured it out. How about the others?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:28pm MST	I'm in a meeting so I don't have my computer out
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:27pm MST	Wanna send me the code?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:27pm MST	I can't figure out how to do the while loop so that it adds each component after checking the approximate error
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:25pm MST	Ok so what's tripping you up about 4.12?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:23pm MST	Looking now
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:12pm MST	Did you get a chance to look at them?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 4:45pm MST	I sent you the book. I'm struggling with the last 3
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 4:35pm MST	jtcelayaalcala@email.arizona.edu
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 4:35pm MST	It's all good, what's your email?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 4:17pm MST	Hey Paul, I'm sorry but my dad wants to meet for dinner, I won't be able to make it. If you email it to me though I'm sure I can fix it/ explain it pretty easy.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	And Paul yeah that works, science engineering?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	That's basically how drones work
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	6:30
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	What time are you free?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	Sounds good
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:37pm MST	MATLAB but it's basic math. As I need help with the setup
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:36pm MST	Yeah what language?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:34pm MST	Jose and Emanuel can either of you help me with some coding hw later today?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:30pm MST	Nope. Fucking unfortunate.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:26pm MST	What about eating babies?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:26pm MST	I wish....
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:26pm MST	Did they ask about world view one and two?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:16pm MST	How has life popped your ballon today Olivia?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:15pm MST	Qu√© pas√≥
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 2:39pm MST	Ughhhhhhhhb
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 1:47pm MST	üôèüôèüôè
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 1:47pm MST	Help Olivia with biochem
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 1:47pm MST	Oh great 2 chainz...
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 1:46pm MST	Let's get this prayer season off to a good start
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 1:46pm MST	Alright y'all
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 1:32pm MST	I'm very annoyed that I find that hilarious
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 12:58pm MST	@Jose
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, September 6, 2017 at 8:50pm MST	I'm on my way.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, September 6, 2017 at 8:30pm MST	We'll be there in 5
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, September 6, 2017 at 8:30pm MST	No anchovies
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, September 6, 2017 at 8:30pm MST	Yep

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 25, 2017 at 9:48am MST	*dungeon
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 25, 2017 at 9:48am MST	It's like a du dungeon
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 25, 2017 at 8:38am MST	So like if it's a Lugia, which is legendary, you need a group of like 12+ to team up and enter the raid together and fight it. If you guys beat it, everyone gets a ton of items and xp, but most importantly you're given like 5-12 premier balls to try to catch it. So it's currently the only way to catch legendaries in the game.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 25, 2017 at 8:36am MST	Basically they're team neutral bosses that pop up at gyms. Theres tiers 1-5, 1 being baby shit pokemon and 5 being legendaries. Tier 1 and 2 and a couple tier 3 bosses can be taken on solo, but anything bigger you need lots of people to team up and fight it
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 25, 2017 at 8:34am MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 25, 2017 at 7:54am MST	You're really dedicated to raids.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 25, 2017 at 7:53am MST	Oh boy. Let me drive to campus and then I will blow your mind

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 24, 2017 at 9:02pm MST	I mean he also listed himself as ceo of his stupid company
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 24, 2017 at 9:02pm MST	Oh yeah he's completely delusional. Don't worry I called him out on his bullshit
Jose Celaya	Thursday, August 24, 2017 at 9:02pm MST	Haha, well I kinda feel bad, it seems like Brady really believes in everything he says
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 24, 2017 at 8:54pm MST	He said &quot;well I go to Mexico two weeks out of the year with my family&quot; and &quot;when I work construction sites with my dad a lot of the workers don't speak English&quot;

Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 12, 2017 at 1:02pm MST	It's a good rule to drink by
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 12, 2017 at 1:02pm MST	Also, @Paul, I've adopted your &quot;I only drink booze that comes in glass&quot; rule.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 12, 2017 at 1:00pm MST	I can't til Monday. I'm in Mexico right now.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 12, 2017 at 12:59pm MST	Can't still in sd
Jose Celaya	Saturday, August 12, 2017 at 12:57pm MST	We gotta do something today or tomorrow. Like food, hookah, etc

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 11, 2017 at 8:27am MST	@Olivia Gorushi the Prednisone may be getting to me. My whole dream last night was really fucking wanting to do dips.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 8, 2017 at 8:01am MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 8, 2017 at 8:01am MST	Thanks fam
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 8, 2017 at 7:53am MST	Not sure. You might want to consult Google. Calamine is more for itchiness, aloe is more for soothing, like a burn.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 8, 2017 at 7:51am MST	Is it better than aloe vera though?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 8, 2017 at 7:41am MST	Recommended treatment is calamine lotion. You can buy it any drug store, it's a pink liquid, should be near the band-aid/Neosporin section.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 8, 2017 at 7:38am MST	My department at Penn. I work in derm
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 8, 2017 at 7:33am MST	That is possible. Who's your dermatology cohort?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 8, 2017 at 7:31am MST	@Emanuel I've consulted with my fellow dermatology cohort. We've come to the conclusion you may have been exposed to poison ivy or poison oak
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:24pm MST	Paul this is ok but I need to plot multiple box and whisker plots side by sidr
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:21pm MST	I mean for data. You have failed me.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:20pm MST	This is math shit jose
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:20pm MST	I was like WHAT JOSE WE ARE WHAT???
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:20pm MST	Meta-chart also works
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:20pm MST	I thought you were trying to tell me something
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:19pm MST	Desmos
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:19pm MST	Goddamit
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:19pm MST	Seamos
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:19pm MST	Or actually a box and whisker plot would be optimal
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:18pm MST	I need to make a bar graph with error bars and Excel is a piece of shit.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:17pm MST	Lol I'm not sure what you need exactly
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:17pm MST	Paul help
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:17pm MST	What was that website you showed me where you could make different charts and graphs and shit
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	@Jose help
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	I'm not down to die to an animal smaller than me.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:55pm MST	You could also have Lyme disease or any of those other shitty tick diseases
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:17pm MST	It could be an allergy. I was shirtless in some dense foliage in Iowa.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:15pm MST	Well, then I got nothing. Unless you developed late onset atopic dermatitis (aka eczema) or psoriasis, my knowledge of skin afflictions has been exhausted.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:13pm MST	None that I haven't taken before.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:12pm MST	Lol that's true I guess. I will pray for your rash. My guess is it's some environmental allergen you're not used to or some food allergen you didn't realize you had. You start any new protein supplements or anything recently?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:10pm MST	I think I've always had the constantly eating thing lol
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:08pm MST	I've taken it for my asthma and Scotts taken it for his Crohn's. It makes both of us roid rage as fuck. Can't stop eating and want to fight every single person we see.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:07pm MST	Sometimes it would feel hot but that was it.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:05pm MST	Oh shit that's a pretty strong dose for a first timer. Shit is ridonkulous. You experiencing roid rage yet?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:05pm MST	30mg a day for three days, then 10 for three days and then finally 5 for three days.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:03pm MST	Lol Prednisone is the shit. How much did they prescribe? Like how many mg? And how many days?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:03pm MST	I'm almost done with it though and it's spread.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:02pm MST	A few weeks. The doctor prescribed some cream and Prednisone
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:02pm MST	And are you applying any sort of cream?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:02pm MST	How long have you had it?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:01pm MST	Hmmmm
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:01pm MST	A few parts are leaky. Mostly it's tender, burning, and itchy.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 4:59pm MST	Benadryl would make it not itchy, but it wouldn't affect how painful it is. Is it like open and bleeding? Or dry and itchy? I'm gonna need some more input
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 4:58pm MST	I don't know. I've been taking so much Benadryl.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 4:56pm MST	Are you in excruciating pain?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 4:55pm MST	It looks so much like shingles.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 4:53pm MST	But you're not 50+ with a history of chicken pox so I doubt you have shingles
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	I mean I could probably do that
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	Can he formally diagnose me with shingles?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	Yup. I'm on season 11 now
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 3:46pm MST	You're always doing that
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	Oh yeah well I'm watching a show where he's a neurosurgeon
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 3:41pm MST	I'm watching a show where Shepard from Grey's anatomy is a young gigalo
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 4:58pm MST	What's cray cray is ice skating. I did it yesterday. That shit is hard.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 2:21pm MST	Yall are cray cray. The computational people in my lab do some dope shit. Plus they could do wet lab stuff too if they wanted to.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 2:14pm MST	No computational biology for me.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 2:03pm MST	That's good. So you and Jose don't wanna be computational biologists, right?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 1:56pm MST	It was actually lit af
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 1:29pm MST	Weird. Was your poster dope af
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 1:29pm MST	It was mostly about history of it in universities and how it still exists.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 1:28pm MST	Wtf
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 1:28pm MST	Someone had a poster on eugenics
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 8:18am MST	Yeah if you guys make a poster and you are going to present it at abrcms then you should include the u of a logo
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 8:12am MST	Yes.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 8:10am MST	At Iowa?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 8:09am MST	*three
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 8:09am MST	I don't understand that message
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 8:08am MST	There's gonna be there of us presenting our poster.

Jose Celaya	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 8:06am MST	Oh ok

Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 8:05am MST	Mine I'd s ppt
Jose Celaya	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 8:05am MST	Wasn't sure
Jose Celaya	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 8:05am MST	Yeah that's what I thought, my professor gave me a choice

Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 3:36pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 3:33pm MST	It's not on my left side cause that's the crip side.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 3:33pm MST	I meant thumb
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 3:31pm MST	I don't understand what is your right thing
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 3:30pm MST	It's on the right side of my ribcage, my right thing, and on the right side of my belly button. I think it's a mixture of sweating more and being in a humid ass place.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:08pm MST	And Emanuel you should elaborate on your rash Olivia seems very concerned
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:08pm MST	üçâ

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:07pm MST	I just wanna sleep. I actually left lab a little early so I could come home and take a nap before working on my poster
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:06pm MST	Olivia you should do something fun one night and completely forget that you ever heard the word &quot;research&quot;
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:05pm MST	Perfect timing
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:05pm MST	Lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:05pm MST	I got a rash
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:05pm MST	I know but I feel like I'm gonna die. I feel super stressed and I have no appetite and everytime I force myself to eat something I feel like I'm gonna vomit. It's terrible
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:04pm MST	Olivia you're dedicated as fuck
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:03pm MST	I stayed home one day last week but yeah I have too much benchwork I still have to do. I've been in my lab like almost 9 hours every weekday and I'm gonna have to go in one day this weekend
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	You don't wanna stay home because you wanna get everything done?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	Idk I just still feel tired and weak and I'm still a little congested but better than I was.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	Posters are annoying
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:01pm MST	Kind of
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:01pm MST	You better now?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:01pm MST	And I'm trying to cram to get everything done to make my poster next week

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:01pm MST	Yeah. I just feel like shit because I'm so tired and I've been sick
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:01pm MST	You can still tout it
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:00pm MST	Exactly
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:00pm MST	I mean it'll be &quot;in preparation&quot;
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:00pm MST	Yeah but probably not until after I graduate
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:00pm MST	It's all worth it
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:00pm MST	But you'll get a paper

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 8:21am MST	But I seriously wanna go home, I actually checked to see how much it would be to change my flight back...$120. So unfortunately I'm definitely stuck over here.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 8:20am MST	Aw damn, I forgot about that. Well, I'm actually not gonna be in town til the 11th. At the beginning of the summer I wasn't sure if I would get into this conference in Columbus but I did. So I'm gone an extra week.

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:49pm MST	Especially when she's being a fucking cunt
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:49pm MST	Ok now just practice saying it in an endearing voice so you can say it to her

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:47pm MST	The word for retarded in Spanish is kind of racist though
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:47pm MST	But really it's the Spanish word for retarded
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:47pm MST	Lol

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:46pm MST	And say it all the time and when she agrees you'll get really pretty satisfaction out of it.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:46pm MST	What should it be?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:46pm MST	You should just make a codeword for retarded in your head
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:46pm MST	Oh shit
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:46pm MST	She's retarded af

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:45pm MST	That's awesome Olivia
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:45pm MST	Hahaha
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:45pm MST	And then she couldn't get mad because you're only imitating the potus
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:45pm MST	She supports trump too?! That retarded ass racist bitch
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:45pm MST	If I were you I would imitate that Trump clip every single time I saw her.

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:44pm MST	Trump supporter
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:44pm MST	Middle class?

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:42pm MST	Thank you guys
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:42pm MST	I told her I wouldn't say it in front of her anymore, she said she'd only forgive me if I promised never to say it again
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:42pm MST	*Act
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:42pm MST	It is literally the American DISABILITY Acr
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:42pm MST	What a retard
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:42pm MST	Wtf how is disabled offensive
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:42pm MST	Well then she's a fucking retard.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:42pm MST	But not nearly as much
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:42pm MST	She thinks &quot;disabled&quot; is also offensive
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:41pm MST	No but she's involved in like advocacy for disabled people
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:41pm MST	Cause usually the people that are super offended know someone personally.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:41pm MST	Your partner is overly sensitive
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:41pm MST	You're right I gotta up my Donald Trump offense game
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:41pm MST	Does she have a retarded brother or something?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:41pm MST	So yeah she lost her shit
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:41pm MST	Instead of saying Donald Trump is retarded, I opt for saying he's a racist douche nozzle
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:40pm MST	I said that sentence and was unapologetic about it, and now my partner says she doesn't respect me as a person
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:40pm MST	Did people lose their shit when they heard you? Lol
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:40pm MST	More than anything I feel like it's a lazy word
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:40pm MST	I thought I was crazy
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:40pm MST	Ok ok
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:40pm MST	And Paul I have the same opinion
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:40pm MST	If you're talking to a group of regular people I agree it's like a 2-3
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:40pm MST	Assume I say it in a room where no one has a disability
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:39pm MST	Well yeah
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:39pm MST	If you say it in a special ed class to a bunch of down syndrome kids it's a 10
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:39pm MST	Depends on the crowd. To me it's like a 2, but I've seen people take it as a 9
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:39pm MST	Those words ruined my day yesterday
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:39pm MST	Like I said &quot;Donald Trump is retarded&quot;
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:38pm MST	How offensive is the word retarded on a scale of 1-10. Where 1 is not at all and 10 is like the same as a racial slur or something to offend gay people
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:37pm MST	Que onda
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:35pm MST	Guys I need to get your opinion

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:40pm MST	It did, but surprisingly and most satisfyingly, the one that came up the most was scrubs.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:37pm MST	If it didn't include ER it's wrong.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:37pm MST	Today I googled what TV shows accurately describe being a doctor
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:36pm MST	Y'all are all my children, no matter what y'all decide to be when you grow up.
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:36pm MST	We can't deny him his destiny
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:35pm MST	He was meant to become and real estate movul
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:35pm MST	*him
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:35pm MST	That's true
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:35pm MST	If we love @Emanuel we gotta set home free and let him be his true self.
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:31pm MST	You're gonna have to make his adoption contingent on it
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:30pm MST	Idk. Maximize your own potential and lead by example? That's all I ever do
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:29pm MST	Olivia how are we gonna convince Emanuel to abandon his slum lord ambitions and go to grad school
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:28pm MST	Honestly I have no idea I don't keep up with rap drama
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:26pm MST	I don't know
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:26pm MST	Or did they make up
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:26pm MST	But I thought they weren't on good terms
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:26pm MST	I thought so
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:26pm MST	Probably lol it looks like ice cube to me.
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:26pm MST	So no I don't know who he is
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:26pm MST	I imagine every rapper has a song where they say that
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:25pm MST	Lmao I have no idea what song you're referring to
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:25pm MST	That one guy that says fuck that shit in his song
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:25pm MST	Jose do you even know who the third rapper is
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:24pm MST	I'll pray to Dr Dre and snoop dog
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:24pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:22pm MST	Like Rhianna says in her song. I think it's Rhianna idk
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:22pm MST	I mean for tests it makes sense to pray to 2chainz since he got a masters with a 4.0 but I need a doctor
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:21pm MST	And if you're going to pray to a rapper y'all should pray to Dr. Dre. Since he's a doctor.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:21pm MST	Fuck you guys I am literally dying. I chugged some NyQuil, pray for me.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:50pm MST	You don't have better shit to do so you just work and do crazy shit
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:49pm MST	I'd rather get lit. I now understand why my dad partied for so long
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:48pm MST	You could sell crack
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:47pm MST	I've thought about it. I could get a job doing computer stuff. I could also do med school. I've always wanted to deliver a baby. I could also use my parent's house to build a real estate empire and become a slum lord.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:45pm MST	Lol I mean when you graduate
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:45pm MST	And no, I don't have anything better to do. I'd be sitting around watching netflix.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:44pm MST	Ok I'll tell him you're down
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:44pm MST	For real though that sounds dope.

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:43pm MST	lol Scott is actually gonna become my dad
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:42pm MST	Also, I mentioned to Scott you were interested in welding, he said if you wanna come over sometime he could teach you, he has all the equipment
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:42pm MST	Do you have something better to do?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:41pm MST	I dunno if that's the problem. We have a whole bunch of shit here. There's VR and 3d printers and a big ass you can get in and see 3d games.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:39pm MST	You should do something in a wet lab it's way fucking cooler
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:36pm MST	When I was in MARC, my lab was kinda shitty, and some of the stuff was kinda boring, but it wasn't unbearable. I just didn't give a shit. I would start shit super late and not even care. Even now as I'm writing papers and shit, we're closing to being done but it being published isn't that big of a deal
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	I dunno
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	Fucking do it
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	I've been thinking about that a lot recently
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	You decide if you're going to apply to grad programs?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:33pm MST	You don't even know.

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:33pm MST	Guys, it's finally hitting me that I'm going to be a senior

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:15pm MST	You can see them on your nearby if you swipe
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:14pm MST	Ok, I'll try them out. There's a gym right near the union here. Might be what I need to catch up
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:14pm MST	There's different tiers. You can definitely‚Äã do level 1 by yourself, maybe some level 2. I would avoid 3 and 4 unless you run into other people also battling.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:12pm MST	Are they hard?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:12pm MST	Oh shit
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:12pm MST	And you get 3000 xp/victory
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:12pm MST	Yeah but raids are different they're cooperative.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:11pm MST	No I don't really go to gyms
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:11pm MST	I need 345000 more
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:11pm MST	Have you been doing raids?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:10pm MST	I forget how many total do though
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:10pm MST	Level 25
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:10pm MST	I believe in you. What do you have to get to to beat me I don't remember
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	69500 til level 22
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	I'm 5500 xp into level 21
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	Lol no, a little over halfway there
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	Lol are you already at 32?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 3:07pm MST	Jose how's that xp coming
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 5:47am MST	Lmao fucking ja rule
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 5:46am MST	This was a close second
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 5:46am MST	I approve
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 5:46am MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 5:46am MST	Sorry. I was running
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 12, 2017 at 5:14am MST	@Emanuel I'm ready to be inspired
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 6:03pm MST	I know I can't believe you guys never told me
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 5:55pm MST	That's an important one.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 5:51pm MST	Buenas suerte
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 5:50pm MST	What's that?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 5:42pm MST	I learned a new thing to say in Spanish
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 5:40pm MST	I took a cycling class today. It was very intense.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 5:39pm MST	But not this year??? Fucking abrcms is so goddamn picky
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 5:38pm MST	Yes
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 4:43pm MST	*anywhere
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 4:41pm MST	Last year for abrcms they required the abstract to be on the poster, right? I don't see that anyway on the guidelines for this year...
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 12:01pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 8:31am MST	We already have one for today. I have one ready for tomorrow
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 7:51am MST	Then do something about it. Instead of saying the grass is always greener, water your damn grass
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 7:50am MST	Haha why? It matches Olivia's humor. Is it because it's not inspiring
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 7:49am MST	I don't like today's picture
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 7:48am MST	Yup
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 7:04am MST	Hey y'all, when you guys made your posters last year y'all made them 3' tall and 4' wide right?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 10, 2017 at 8:35am MST	Down AF
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 10, 2017 at 6:54am MST	You can. I believe in you
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 10, 2017 at 6:53am MST	Sometimes I wish I could do that
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 10, 2017 at 6:09am MST	He's just hanging out with his giant paper bag paper thing.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 10, 2017 at 4:49am MST	What is he doing?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 10, 2017 at 4:47am MST	That is the male orangutan, trying to make the best of his circumstances, approximately 15 minutes before his girlfriend started having her baby. I guess the inspirational aspect that I take away is try to enjoy your shitty life, because at any moment, it could get way shittier.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 10, 2017 at 4:45am MST	Is that a pile of trash?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 9, 2017 at 6:58pm MST	But that's prime orangatan labor viewing time
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 9, 2017 at 6:35pm MST	Well they made us leave before the baby was actually born, but still dope af
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 9, 2017 at 6:34pm MST	What was it like?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 9, 2017 at 6:18pm MST	Bruh. Before I wanted to be a microbiologist, I wanted to be a vet. I wanted to specialize in exotic animals. Primates are my favorite, and great apes are my favorite of the primates, and orangutans are my favorite of the great apes.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 9, 2017 at 6:17pm MST	I never knew you had a favorite primate
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 9, 2017 at 6:15pm MST	Also, disclaimer, orangutans are my #1 favorite primate, and probably like in the top 3 favorite animal.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 9, 2017 at 6:15pm MST	I saw a fucking orangutan. Go into labor. Holy shit.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 9, 2017 at 6:14pm MST	Do tell
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 9, 2017 at 6:14pm MST	I have had a life changing experience today
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 9, 2017 at 6:13pm MST	Oh shit
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 9, 2017 at 6:08pm MST	Holy shit you guys
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 9, 2017 at 6:30am MST	Lol
Daniel Osorio	Saturday, July 8, 2017 at 11:25pm MST	I'm proud to say that I have no idea who any of those people are
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 8:47pm MST	It was pretty good and aesthetically pleasing
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 7:13pm MST	That sounds bomb.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 7:12pm MST	I just made banana pudding
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 5:37pm MST	I did, mostly just to rub it in his face lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 5:36pm MST	I'm gonna tell him
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 5:27pm MST	Hall of the mountain king. Un fucking believable.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 5:27pm MST	I know what it is but I don't know what it's called
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 5:23pm MST	Holy shit emanuel. You will never guess what song Scott forgot to add.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 5:13pm MST	Is it lit tho?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 5:05pm MST	Legit. In other news, Scott has finally accepted Spotify into his heart and we are collaborating on an opera/classical playlist.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 4:59pm MST	Decent. We'll start running people through our experiment the week after next.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 4:58pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 4:58pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 3:48pm MST	Agreed. How's your lab stuff going?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 3:28pm MST	That's more than sufficient celebration
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 3:22pm MST	Lol I'm eating ramen and watching Grey's anatomy
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 3:21pm MST	Are you going to celebrate?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 3:17pm MST	Like almost 4 weeks
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 3:17pm MST	How long did it take you to do all those extractions?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 3:17pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 3:17pm MST	Nah. I'm not trying to write that shit.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 3:02pm MST	Wait, are you also gonna first author on your upcoming publication???
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 3:02pm MST	Oh shit
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 3:01pm MST	Is it me?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 2:52pm MST	Guess who has two thumbs and has finally completed ALL 237 DNA and ALL 233 RNA extractions
Daniel Osorio	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 8:07am MST	guess I'll save 150 dlls
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 7:54am MST	Same as Olivia for bioengineering
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 6:19am MST	Every faculty member I talked to said don't bother for bio majors
Jose Celaya	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 6:14am MST	Yep, math in the fall
Daniel Osorio	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 6:14am MST	guys random question, is any of you taking any of the gre subject tests?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 5:51am MST	Fog is weird af
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 5:07am MST	Agreed...
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 5:07am MST	How unsatisfying
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 5:06am MST	Nope...I think I still got my point across without the word though
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 7, 2017 at 5:05am MST	Reified
Jose Celaya	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 7:58pm MST	Will do
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 7:58pm MST	Hmmm no I don't like that one. Oh well if it comes to you in the middle of the night shoot me a message lol
Jose Celaya	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 7:57pm MST	Vindicate?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 7:54pm MST	Validated is definitely closer
Jose Celaya	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 7:54pm MST	Validated your abilities?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 7:53pm MST	@Jose any idea wtf I'm trying to say? Lol you can usually guess the word im looking for
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 7:50pm MST	I'm talking about my experience at Penn, and how it has instilled me with confidence, it helped me overcome imposters syndrome. It like [justified, proved, some word] that I deserved to be there, that I earned it, etc
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 7:48pm MST	Hey guys I need help thinking of a specific word.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	Holy shit Daniel you came out of nowhere....It's so fucking stupid right? Like just look at my transcripts and my CV and if you don't feel like I've earned a spot in your program, thanks for your time.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	It's always weird because I feel like I have to up play my lack of privilege when in reality my life has always been pretty good
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 6:08pm MST	thank you, I also hate personal statements for the exact same reason
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 6:08pm MST	I just feel like it's this fake combination of humble bragging about your accomplishments and self pity about how you were underprivileged but not too underprivileged because God forbid it comes off like a sob story.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 6:05pm MST	Why?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 6:04pm MST	Also, I am full of shit. I fucking hate writing personal statements
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 6:04pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 6:03pm MST	Fast af tho
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 6:01pm MST	As a micro major, ew.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 6:00pm MST	It's important to keep an efficient system even if that means peeing and brushing your teeth at the same time
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 5:58pm MST	Lol I'm not sure how those things are related but I think you should go for it.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 5:58pm MST	I'm consider industrial engineering more and more. In my personal statement, I could talk about how I would get ready so fast as a kid that my dad thought I wasn't brushing my teeth
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 5:56pm MST	Always do the weird shit. Also, this lab might actually be more disgusting than the bear poop lab, it's awesome.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 5:56pm MST	I'm not sure if I want to do computer science or some weird shit I don't know about
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 5:55pm MST	Yup. Its pretty dope knowing what your thing is. Microbes are my thing.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 5:54pm MST	Then it sounds like micro grad school is the place for you
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 5:53pm MST	But I love microbes....
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 5:51pm MST	It's grad school. You can do anything you want.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 5:46pm MST	Lol yeah what else would I do???
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 5:43pm MST	Are you gonna go to grad school for micro?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 5:40pm MST	Writing personal statements. I find the activity inspiring af
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 5:39pm MST	What inspires you @Olivia Gorushi?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 5:47am MST	üçâ

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 12:48pm MST	Guys don't forget to do that nih shit online @Paul @Jose @Daniel
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 10:52am MST	*weird
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 10:52am MST	This guy sounds said
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 10:16am MST	Fuck his girlfriend.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:51am MST	Get him blackout drunk and make him think he slept with a dude like in it's always sunny
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:45am MST	He's such a dick though... Treats her like trash too
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:42am MST	Don't do that, if he throws a fit when you don't eat where he wants, he'll shoot you you if you do that
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:40am MST	My other roommate said I should fuck his girl
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:40am MST	I could get kicked out for that
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:40am MST	Just beat him up
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:35am MST	Also, if we're eating as a group and we don't eat where he wants, he will throw a silent fit all day
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:25am MST	I know right
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:24am MST	Fuck that guy
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:24am MST	Oh shit
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:24am MST	It's cause she's kinda casually racist
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:24am MST	He's one of those Mexicans that says he will never speak Spanish unless he has to though
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:24am MST	Lol odd that you address your friends by race, but no he's Mexican
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:23am MST	My white friend wants to know for some reason
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:23am MST	Is he Asian?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:22am MST	Also he put ramen in the microwave without adding water so of course that shit burned up entirely and now out house smells like burnt styrofoam
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:21am MST	Like idk how this girl puts up with him, he's such a little brat
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:19am MST	He's the biggest child I've ever met. He's 24 and he still throws little fits to his gf over the dumbest things
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:18am MST	What did he do?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:16am MST	I really dislike one of my roommates
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 7:13am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 7:09am MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 6:47am MST	On Scott?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 6:25am MST	Already back to grinding.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 6:03am MST	Damn that sounds awesome. Are you gonna be able to go back to your simple life of RNA extractions?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 6:02am MST	I took several, obviously I'll post the finale but I'll have to decide what else. I saw fireworks on Friday too, and there was a show Saturday but Scotts flight was delayed so we missed it. They do not fuck around with fireworks in Philly
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 6:01am MST	Do post the video
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 6:01am MST	Aw that's too bad
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 6:01am MST	I'm gonna post video later, but I saw them from the waterfront over the Delaware River
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 6:00am MST	I saw fireworks from the sky
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 6:00am MST	He had to leave for the airport at 3pm but he at least got to see the parade.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 6:00am MST	Wow
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 6:00am MST	Thousands?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 5:59am MST	I went to the 2nd dopest shit and there was still thousands of people.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 5:59am MST	Did Scott agree that it was dope enough to cause an overdose?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 5:59am MST	Oh shit
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 5:59am MST	It was so dope I didn't even go to the dopest shit because it was overwhelmingly dope.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 5:59am MST	Olivia was 4th of July in philly as dope as you thought?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 5:58am MST	Lol
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 3, 2017 at 8:26am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 3, 2017 at 8:25am MST	Idk why I can't change the photo I keep getting errors..
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 3, 2017 at 7:17am MST	Thanks fam
Jose Celaya	Sunday, July 2, 2017 at 8:21am MST	So I think any box that can run kodi would work
Jose Celaya	Sunday, July 2, 2017 at 8:20am MST	The program is kodi, and the add on is exodus
Jose Celaya	Sunday, July 2, 2017 at 8:20am MST	This one is called &quot;mi box&quot;
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 2, 2017 at 7:49am MST	@Jose Celaya what's that box for your TV called again?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 7:31pm MST	This bar is playing lil yachty. Fuck yes.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 6:14pm MST	I'll pray for you Jose
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:56pm MST	I might die
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:56pm MST	And I'm about to go to dinner
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:56pm MST	Olivia it's I feel like it's 9 but it's 6 here
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:55pm MST	Lol conversations on here are always the best
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:36pm MST	I don't have a passport...
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:36pm MST	That's wild. You should just go to europe
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	Also did you know that being in Philly, I am closer to Europe than Tucson???
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	Dope af.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:33pm MST	HOw is it so far?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:26pm MST	Nah fam I've been eating rice, ramen, and tuna. Dont need no fucking cutting board. I'm trying to get the real college experience
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:25pm MST	You monster. Everyone needs a cutting board. Fuck pigeons.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:25pm MST	Also there's a pigeon walking around the airport like 5 feet from me
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:25pm MST	But my kitchen is literally a closet.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:24pm MST	I still don't have a cutting board....
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:24pm MST	I was in some girls' apartment last night, and I was offended. They didn't have a cutting board and their kitchen trashcan was so small.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:23pm MST	That's the message: girls are fucking assholes to each other. And they should stop.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:23pm MST	I don't know how I'm still sane, to be honest.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:23pm MST	What is the message about how shitty girls treat eachother?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:23pm MST	Exactly! I dont know how he's going to fare in my very tiny apartment with two 21 year old girls.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:21pm MST	That's why we're perfect together.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:21pm MST	Scott is such an old man
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:21pm MST	It's the perfect balance of plot, comic relief, and a super good message about how shitty girls treat each other
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:20pm MST	Yup. Scott is coming here because he hates Phoenix that much.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:20pm MST	Yes. I have seen it at least twice.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:20pm MST	It make more sense why Jose is homesick
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:19pm MST	I love mean girls. It's one of the best movies ever made. Have you seen it
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:19pm MST	You're out of control
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:18pm MST	Lol my phone gave me a suggestion to search &quot;mean girls&quot; because of my phrasing lol my phone knows me way too well
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:18pm MST	Lol girls
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:18pm MST	By people do you mean girls or just a variety of people.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:17pm MST	All I wanted to do was drink water to not be hung over.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:17pm MST	Ok that makes a little more sense.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:16pm MST	I was being physically pulled to get grinded on by people dancing. I ddin't want to so I had to resist the people phsyically pulling on me.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:16pm MST	I thought it was a reference to his disapproval that if I possessed his body that I wouldn't pull out. But still doesn't make any more sense.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:15pm MST	Still nothing
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:15pm MST	I read it like 3 times
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:15pm MST	Lol ok good it wasn't just me.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:15pm MST	Lol
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:15pm MST	I don't understand that message
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:15pm MST	I don't understand that sentence.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:13pm MST	I miss you guys too. I had to fight being pulled out to get grinded on.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:13pm MST	Probably. Like where else would he have gone previously?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:12pm MST	Do you know if this summer is the first time that Jose's not lived with his family?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:12pm MST	I miss you guys like everyday. Y'all are way more adulty than any of these kids I'm stuck with.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:11pm MST	Missing that is my biggest disappointment this summer. Well I guess it's tied with Scotts flight being delayed.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:11pm MST	Life is tragic. I even told Jose I missed him. You could've gotten an I miss you message too.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:10pm MST	I know! And I was even up like really late for me. I must have gone to sleep like &lt;10 minutes after you messaged‚Äã us
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:09pm MST	I was pretty drunk. You missed out on the drunk texting.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:09pm MST	Time flies when you're drunk
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:08pm MST	I knew it was this weekend, but it got here so fast.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:08pm MST	Lol when did you think he was coming?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:08pm MST	I didn't realize he'd be there so soon
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:07pm MST	Oh shit
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:07pm MST	I'm waiting for Scott at the airport. His flight was delayed by like an hour and 15 minutes...
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:06pm MST	I fucking love cheese
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:06pm MST	@Jose Celaya I still get relief from seeing my B in analysis on D2l
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:05pm MST	Yeah when I get Mexican shredded cheese I think it's just like sharp cheddar and Jack and something else
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:05pm MST	It has the same texture. It doesnt really task like anything though
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	Then no
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:02pm MST	I have had shredded cheese in a bag with three types of cheese and they call it Mexican cheese. Is that what you mean?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:02pm MST	Have you ever had mexican cheese?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 3:02pm MST	How is it?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 2:50pm MST	To see how the other side lives
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 2:11pm MST	I just bought a whole bunch of tofu
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 1:58pm MST	Like I'm pretty sure she's your illegitimate child
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 1:57pm MST	I will adopt that little girl
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 1:42pm MST	@Emanuel the child saying they smell like beef reminded me of you.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 8:21am MST	Lol #level42
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 8:21am MST	And apparently it's not legal because it's the distribution of food or some bullshit obscure laws that nobody cares about. So all the PoGo players fucking hate her. No worries I'm going shopping in a little bit.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 8:21am MST	I'll let you know when I get to level 42 tonight
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 8:21am MST	Ok, I'm gonna have to leave again
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 8:21am MST	That's retarded
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 8:20am MST	They weren't buying hers I mean
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 8:20am MST	People would like bring 24 packs of water last summer and give them out and not sell them or anything and she would call the cops on them because they were buying her for $2/bottle.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 8:19am MST	Lol fuck her
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 8:19am MST	Also don't buy anything from the ice cream lady there she is a total fucking bitch

Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, June 28, 2017 at 8:23pm MST	Sneak some into Scott's luggage when he leaves
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 28, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	Maybe they just need a ride.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, June 28, 2017 at 7:40pm MST	If they could live there they'd probably live there
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 28, 2017 at 6:07pm MST	I want to take some home with me. Do you think I could breed them and introduce them into the ecosystem back home
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, June 28, 2017 at 6:03pm MST	They're cool as fuck

Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 4:59pm MST	I'm on episode 4
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 27, 2017 at 4:59pm MST	I'd say Dee is the only sane one

Jose Celaya	Monday, June 26, 2017 at 5:52am MST	What happens next, I don't know.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 26, 2017 at 5:51am MST	You were making breakfast, but stopped all of a sudden, that's why your keycard and wallet are out like that. You stopped because you heard a noise, you see the aloe...and you remember. Someone from your past said they'd make contact again, and that they would point aloe in the direction they were going next. You run out to find them, in such a hurry you don't even put on your shoes.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 26, 2017 at 4:56am MST	Hey do you guys know that game where I show you like three random pictures and you have to make up a story explaining how they some sort of logical sense? @Emanuel I feel like you'd be good at this game
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 26, 2017 at 4:34am MST	Just replace the word shark with Olivia and shit is still true.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 26, 2017 at 4:34am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 26, 2017 at 4:33am MST	üçâ

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:23pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:17pm MST	I'm sorry emanuel. The hammock is in the past. Maybe next weekend when Scott visits
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:04pm MST	I wanna see the hammock
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 11:53am MST	I didn't take pics of the hammock but I did of the water front
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 11:53am MST	Pics or it never happened
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:32am MST	So I'm laying in a hammock in the shade in a park by the river and it's like 80 degrees out. I'm pretty sure this is the life.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:51am MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:50am MST	That's fair
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:48am MST	Ok you get minus adult points now. You are back to 21
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:47am MST	No but that's fucking cool. It's when you make a whole with your key in the can so that you can chug it as fast as possible.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:46am MST	I feel like shotgunned does not mean shot with a shotgun in this context.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:45am MST	This is the perfect time to mention I shotgunned cheap gas station beer in front of a hair salon last night.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:44am MST	Fuck yeah so you're preparing dinner already? Adult af
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:43am MST	Yes and zoodles
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:43am MST	I made it once before just in a pan. I'm gonna do that again. They're not too thicc
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:42am MST	Isn't top round more of a roast? I've never cooked that cut...How are you going to cook them? You got some potatoes to go with it?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:41am MST	They're only like five bucks each here.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:41am MST	Look at all these fucking steaks I'm going to eat
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:36am MST	Ok good because that's what I was trying to convey to you
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:36am MST	I just remembered how many fucking cutting boards you have.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:36am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:34am MST	That's what she said
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:33am MST	I have a tiny one that I very much enjoy
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:33am MST	Yeah but I have no place to put it. I have like one square foot of counter space on my kitchen
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:32am MST	That's a big deal. Your gotta fucking buy one.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:31am MST	I am experiencing a severe shortage of cutting boards here.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:31am MST	That seems like a lot of work, i wish I could participate
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:31am MST	Looks dope
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:30am MST	The pasta formerly known as zuccini
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:30am MST	You gotta send a picture
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:30am MST	It's when you make zuccini noodles
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:30am MST	What are you saying emanuel
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:30am MST	My bed is super small and uncomfortable. The springs like jab into your back.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:29am MST	I'm zoodling right now
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:29am MST	The ultimate human state is lying in bed
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:29am MST	It's so warm and comfortable
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:29am MST	I haven't gotten out of bed either
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:28am MST	Fuck that. I enjoy spending time with you guys. Not these kids.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:28am MST	I mean sometimes I feel lazy because I have a special bond with my bed and I don't want to get out of it, but I'll make myself get up eventually. But that's just laziness it has nothing to do with fomo
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:27am MST	Start a group chat
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:27am MST	Invite them to a BBQ
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:27am MST	That's why you gotta spend more time with them
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:27am MST	They don't know you well enough
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:27am MST	I only go to shit I wanna go to
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:27am MST	Hahaha
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:27am MST	That's exactly what I said!!! And nobody believes me!!!
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:26am MST	I feel like you don't get FOMO
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:25am MST	Yeah you go because you have FOMO or you say I was gonna stay home tonight but I didn't wanna get FOMO.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:25am MST	I like it
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:24am MST	It's called FOMO. It's short for fear of missing out.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:24am MST	So basically when someone invites you to something and you kinda don't really feel like going but you reluctantly agree anyway because you don't want to be left out or miss something fun
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:23am MST	I guess it's an east coast thing
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:23am MST	Nah
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:23am MST	Nope
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:23am MST	Have you guys ever heard of FOMO?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:22am MST	Then sleep and dream about food
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:22am MST	But I don't wanna get up...
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:22am MST	Go forth and gather food
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:22am MST	I'm going to go down to the boardwalk later
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:21am MST	Fuck I should probably get out of bed and eat something
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:21am MST	Lmao true
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:21am MST	It wouldn't be a big adjustment
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:21am MST	Olivia you already have president level security
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:20am MST	We have front desk staff 24/7, plus a security guard, plus keycard only access, plus an RA, plus you need your keycard to get into the apartment too
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:20am MST	Like half of them are from Indiana
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:20am MST	No actually a lot less of these people have smoked weed
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:20am MST	Hm
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:20am MST	We have one but I've never seen them
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:19am MST	Yeah, it's super secure here
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:19am MST	You guys have an RA?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:19am MST	I feel like that's risky in university housing
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:19am MST	Weed?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:19am MST	Yup same over here
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:19am MST	People have started getting booze and weed
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:18am MST	I would love to see the meme organization scheme you come up with
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:17am MST	Fuck being president I just wanna be PI
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:17am MST	I really need to apply my organizational skills to my image collection. I know all the memes I have in my phone but they're just in the order they were downloaded they're not organized in anyway so I always know what I'm looking for and roughly where it should be but it still takes me forever to find it
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:16am MST	Olivia you're probably gonna be president
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:16am MST	Oh shit
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:14am MST	What's that mean?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:14am MST	It's been getting a little trappy here lately
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:14am MST	I feel like there's a meme in there somewhere
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:14am MST	I'm here to build my CV and hopefully publish
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:13am MST	Yeah they're all just here to hookup with each other.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:13am MST	Ha well ok I can't really argue with that
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:13am MST	I like the people in my lab I talk to them
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:12am MST	I know them I just don't like them lol
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:12am MST	You might find out that they play Pok√©mon too
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:12am MST	Meet people Olivia
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:11am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:09am MST	I went to dinner with one of my roommates last night, but other than that I've mostly been avoiding the other people in my program. I do most shit on my own
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:08am MST	If it wasn't for hanging out with the people here I would probably be bored as shit
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:08am MST	It's been like mid 70s for the last few days
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:08am MST	I won't deny that
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:08am MST	But the weather here has been pretty awesome
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:08am MST	I guess that's all there is to do in Indianapolis
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:08am MST	I swear though, Tucson sis way more fun
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:07am MST	I mean I've eaten at cool places, went to this one place where they make ice cream with liquid nitrogen. We've played some games together, I've walked around a lot. Gone to the movies
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:06am MST	Have you even done anything fun since you've been there
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:06am MST	Omg
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:06am MST	I missed Tucson so much by the 3rd day I basically swore to myself I'd never go farther than Phoenix again
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:05am MST	It used to be so much worse
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:05am MST	Y'all are ridiculous
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:05am MST	Emanuel you're getting me homesick again
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:05am MST	In Philadelphia there's hills, but you don't really see mountains until you drive out of the city
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:05am MST	Mountains are awesome
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:04am MST	Flat ass shit
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:04am MST	I miss mountains. It's flat as fuck here.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:04am MST	You have, like everyone in Tucson just says it's the smell of rain, but rain only smells like that in the Sonoran desert because of creosote, it's a bush
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:04am MST	I know what you're talking about
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:03am MST	But maybe I have and I don't remember
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:03am MST	Hmm, I don't think I've ever smelled something before rain
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:02am MST	Creosote, greasewood...You know when it rains or monsoons and the air smells really good and everyone says it smells like it's gonna rain?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:02am MST	That sounds awesome
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:02am MST	There's like 2 white ish people in my group of 40
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:01am MST	What the fuck is creosote
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:01am MST	And I'm the only non white person in the REU that has 9 people
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:00am MST	Also there is a significant lack of brown people here
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:00am MST	Those confused me so much the first time I saw them
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:00am MST	The only thing I'll miss about Tucson is the smell of creosote. And good Mexican food. Literally the only things.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:00am MST	Haha that's great
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:59am MST	Every time I see a blinking red stop light I think of Tucson
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:59am MST	Even the hookah lounges
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:59am MST	I like it here but I definitely miss Tucson
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:59am MST	And there is ZERO shit to do if you're not 21
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:58am MST	But it's not as charming
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:58am MST	And there is about the same amount of stuff downtown
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:58am MST	I mean it's basically the same size, a little bigger
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:58am MST	You're crazy. Indianapolis must really suck if Tucson is better
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:57am MST	Tucson's great
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:57am MST	I will, I will don't worry
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:57am MST	Tucson blows I never wanna go back
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:57am MST	Like I'm looking forward to the 112 degree heat
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:56am MST	Paul I can't believe Jose didn't change the air in his tires...
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:56am MST	Yeah but I really miss Tucson
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:56am MST	Getting there the 30th at 11:40pm, and coming back the4th at 4:45
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:56am MST	I hear it's been real fucking hot lately.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:56am MST	Lame. Don't die.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:55am MST	Yeah
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:55am MST	What? You're going back home for the weekend?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:55am MST	Hot air expands. You gotta let out your all your winter air in your tires and refill it with summer air
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:54am MST	I'll do it Saturday
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:54am MST	That's a thing?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:54am MST	...no
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:54am MST	Which reminds me @Jose did you remember to put summer air in your tires before you left for your program?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:51am MST	That's a good price but damn it still hurts shelling out that much money. But also keep an eye on your gas mileage, I bet it'll go up a little bit.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:50am MST	My original wheels were 20&quot;
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:49am MST	Nah i kept getting flats with the low pros. Also those were gonna be $800 for the 4 tires. With regulars on 17&quot; wheels I paid $946
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:48am MST	Are they still low profile?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:48am MST	Holy shit lol how much did you spend?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:48am MST	I know but I sprang for new wheels too
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:47am MST	Shits expensive
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:47am MST	I had to get new tires though
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:47am MST	We have faith in you. This shit is pretty dope I think you'll enjoy yourself at ucsd
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:46am MST	Good you're better off with your car.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:46am MST	6 whole hours
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:46am MST	Driving
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:45am MST	Fuck yeah are you flying or driving?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:45am MST	I'm am about to embark on my journey
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:44am MST	S√≠ se puede Olivia
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:42am MST	Yeah but it's a really big level...
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:41am MST	One more level to win
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:41am MST	Damn
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:40am MST	Thanks. It's the best hat they've had so far.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:39am MST	I like your hat
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 7:59pm MST	Jose they lowered raid level to 25
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:54pm MST	We're all going to dinner in 5
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:54pm MST	I may or may not be able to answer
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:54pm MST	Sounds good
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:53pm MST	Yeah fuck nucleic acids
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:53pm MST	I'm gonna a shower real quick I'll be back, better start leveling up
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:53pm MST	Stupid genetic information
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:53pm MST	Some kind of NA always has to be extracted
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:53pm MST	I know...
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:52pm MST	The extractions never end
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:52pm MST	Oh my god
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:52pm MST	So fucking relieved. But I'll probably be starting my RNA extractions this week, so not that happy yet lol. But at least one of the other undergrads finished her project so she's going to help me
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:51pm MST	How happy are you?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:51pm MST	Oh shit
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:51pm MST	I finished my DNA extractions earlier today!
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:50pm MST	Well it's probably well earned
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:50pm MST	Haha
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:50pm MST	It was their annual lab fun day
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:50pm MST	Well that was specifically my lab, nobody else from my program went.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:49pm MST	You guys have such cool activities
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:49pm MST	I was so sore when I woke up because our lab went white water rafting yesterday so I decided I needed lots of protein
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:48pm MST	Then you should continue the theme
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:48pm MST	Lol that was my breakfast
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:48pm MST	Something with an unholy amount of meat
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:48pm MST	Idk what I should eat for dinner..
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:47pm MST	I should've
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:47pm MST	I know
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:47pm MST	Willing to let it go
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:47pm MST	You already knew that I don't really like cheese, shouldn't you have expected something like this?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:47pm MST	But I'm forgiving
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:46pm MST	I can't believe I talked to you for a whole year, while you kept this hideous secret
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:46pm MST	Wow. See I could have just given you all the pink ones the next time I'm eating starburst. But now I don't wanna.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:45pm MST	Friendship over
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:45pm MST	I actually don't like the pink ones. The yellow ones are ok but the orange ones are the best.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:45pm MST	I'm a pink starburst
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:45pm MST	Do it.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:44pm MST	I believe in myself though
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:44pm MST	Goddamit
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:44pm MST	I hope you know I've been playing this whole time.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:44pm MST	Just no real money
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:44pm MST	Yeah
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:43pm MST	We should also agree not to spend real currency to buy lucky eggs and shit. Coins won in gyms are fair game though?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:43pm MST	I have 2 now
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:43pm MST	You'll get more lucky eggs and more egg incubators at every multiple of 5 level, so 5, 10, 15, etc
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:42pm MST	But if I'm gonna win the race...
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:42pm MST	I haven't done it cause I'm impatient
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:42pm MST	Oh yeah I think I've heard of that
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:42pm MST	Then if you're evolving any new Pokemon, that bonus will also get doubled.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:41pm MST	Basically just horde the stuff you catch and hatch until you have ~60 pokemon to evolve, then hatch a lucky egg to give you double XP for 30 minutes.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:41pm MST	Not sure
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:40pm MST	I told you about power leveling though right?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:40pm MST	I love those
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:40pm MST	Yep
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:40pm MST	Oh yeah lol I'm at like 203 or something. See everytime you catch a pokemon for the first time and add it to your Pokedex, you get a bonus of 500 xp
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:39pm MST	74
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:38pm MST	That's pretty close, plus you still have a lot of pokemon to discover, whereas my Pokedex is almost complete, so that'll help you make up the difference. What's your Pokedex caught total?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:37pm MST	Eh that's not a bad race
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:37pm MST	Well it would take 524,000 for you to get to level 25 from where you are now, and it would take 505,000 for me to get to level 32 from where I am now.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:34pm MST	Missed a 0 but yep
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:34pm MST	186,00
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:34pm MST	Like 180k ish?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:34pm MST	What's your lifetime xp right now?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:33pm MST	Ok I'm trying to think of a relatively fair goal for each of us hold on.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:33pm MST	Very down
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:33pm MST	Haha
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:32pm MST	We could always race you know...
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:32pm MST	I'll choose to believe
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:31pm MST	Ok
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:31pm MST	Lol we can do it Jose. Si se puede
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:31pm MST	That's cray cray
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:31pm MST	Yeah no
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:30pm MST	Did you say 'almost' 1%?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:30pm MST	Lol but you're almost 1% of the way to level 40
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:30pm MST	I'll just make my goal 30
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:29pm MST	I don't want to have to play til I'm 25
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:29pm MST	We can do it Jose.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:28pm MST	That's not ok
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:28pm MST	There now it shared. Read and weep with me.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:27pm MST	WTF my phone is being stupid hold on
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:27pm MST	At this rate you'll have to play for seven years
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:26pm MST	How do people reach level 40?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:26pm MST	What the hell?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:26pm MST	I'm almost 12.5% of the way to level 40 based on lifetime xp
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	That would frustrate me
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	Oh my gosh
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	By the time I hit it it probably won't be the cap anymore
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	That's gonna be a long time from now
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:23pm MST	Olivia what are you gonna do when you reach level 40?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:23pm MST	Before that, the Lapras I caught that one day when I ran out of cactus grill was pretty dope, even though it's super weak. Also Porygon is dope af
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:22pm MST	I just got my first Muk from the raid I just did today, it was one of the last of the original 150 besides legendaries and regionals that I still needed.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:22pm MST	The internet lies
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:22pm MST	Oh I thought they were
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:21pm MST	Lol no legendaries still haven't been released.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:21pm MST	I've caught 38 Poliwag and 19 tediursa lol they're pretty cute
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:20pm MST	You catch mewtwo?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:19pm MST	You?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:19pm MST	They seem pretty cool
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:19pm MST	I've got this poliwag and tediursa
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:18pm MST	Lol what's like the rarest coolest pokemon you caught or evolved so far?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:17pm MST	I have got to step up my game
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:17pm MST	*caught 184. I do not currently have 184 lol
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:16pm MST	Apparently I've got 184.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:16pm MST	Yeah I've caught like one here
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:15pm MST	Personally, I try to make my buddy whatever is super rare and hard to find. Eevee used to be way more common but a lot of people complained, so I think they changed it.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:14pm MST	An eevee
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:14pm MST	Who's your buddy
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:11pm MST	Holy shit

Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:11pm MST	56
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:10pm MST	Like go to your Pokedex and click ratatta. How many have you caught?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:10pm MST	And yeah if it weren't for the poke stop at my dorm I wouldn't be at this level
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:10pm MST	You catch everything, trade in your junk for candy, evolve, get points, trade it in, repeat.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:10pm MST	Haha I thought I was the only one that noticed the wandering thing
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:09pm MST	Plus I just catch everything I see, and spin the stop at my dorm all the time.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:09pm MST	Oh. Well i try to keep it open whenever I can, even if it's just idling because my person wanders and it hatches my eggs faster.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:09pm MST	I know you've been playing for a year
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:08pm MST	Today
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:08pm MST	Or ever
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:08pm MST	Today?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:08pm MST	How long have you been playing?

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:06pm MST	How many pts is it from 18 to 19?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:04pm MST	Just get out there and grind
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:04pm MST	I hope it goes down more
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:04pm MST	I haven't looked into Facebook yet
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:03pm MST	I don't know if it's gone down anymore. Are you in the Facebook group?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:03pm MST	Like when it started last night it was 35+ then it went down to 31+ then it was 28+
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:03pm MST	I'm 19

Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	It's not unlocked for my level
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	I wish I could raid

Jose Celaya	Friday, June 23, 2017 at 7:19am MST	Yeah but no one says &quot;un cuarto m√°s de diez&quot;
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 23, 2017 at 7:16am MST	Cuarto
Jose Celaya	Friday, June 23, 2017 at 7:15am MST	I don't think so
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 23, 2017 at 7:15am MST	Instead of 15
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 23, 2017 at 7:15am MST	No but isn't there a way to say like a quarter past
Jose Celaya	Friday, June 23, 2017 at 7:15am MST	Or diez con quince
Jose Celaya	Friday, June 23, 2017 at 7:14am MST	Diez quince

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 22, 2017 at 4:53pm MST	Ugh I rode the bus in the wrong direction. I have been working way too fucking much I'm so dumb now
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 22, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	That means you're high as fuck.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, June 22, 2017 at 1:09pm MST	Nice
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 22, 2017 at 8:13am MST	I must have smoked so much I can't even remember smoking. I've been here since 7am but I feel like it's been days, but I'm actually moving pretty quick and making good time
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 22, 2017 at 8:12am MST	I'm gonna tell Cindy you're smoking weed
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 22, 2017 at 7:10am MST	Holy fuck. Everything in my lab is taking so goddamn long, I feel like I'm high af or something.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 22, 2017 at 4:52am MST	It's one of my favorites

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 22, 2017 at 4:50am MST	I like this one
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 2:28pm MST	Why?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 2:08pm MST	Yeah it looks pretty awesome, rain here is cool too but I feel like it's more boring somehow
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 1:54pm MST	I love it provided I'm adequately prepared if I'm in it. It's just cool with the clouds and stuff being in a really tall building.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 1:53pm MST	I like it as long as I'm not in it
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 1:53pm MST	Do you like rain or hate it?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 1:52pm MST	It's raining here again y'all

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 10:31am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 8:43am MST	I know expectation is the root of all heart break, but I'm willing to take a risk here
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 8:43am MST	Olivia I'm feeling a sincere lack of inspiration
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 5:59pm MST	You fucking monster
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	I should not have started my laundry so late...
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 4:12pm MST	I just realized I never finished cropping the group pic this morning....My bad guys
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:34pm MST	Best gif ever
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:33pm MST	Sorry I just found this and it is almost as amazing a rendition as the original. Holy God.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:33pm MST	That was crazy
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:33pm MST	Oh...my....god
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:32pm MST	I'll do my best
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:31pm MST	To train them is my cause.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:31pm MST	To catch them is my real quest.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:31pm MST	I feel like you're yoda
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:31pm MST	Like no one ever was.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:30pm MST	We will train together to be the very best.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:30pm MST	I have so much faith rn Olivia
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:30pm MST	I also believe
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:30pm MST	It's a big deal. I believe in you Jose. You can get to level 30.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:28pm MST	I remember too, you were more excited about that than your actual birthday
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:28pm MST	Right? It was on my birthday. I remember.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:28pm MST	Nah cause once you hit level 30, other players start taking you seriously. You get respect.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:27pm MST	I still have the picture when you got to 30 like 2 months ago
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:27pm MST	I might get discouraged at that point
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:27pm MST	Wtf
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:27pm MST	Oh my god

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:26pm MST	How many points from 30 to 31?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:25pm MST	Right? It's cause they're all squished together.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:25pm MST	I mean 31
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:25pm MST	How much from 30 to 32?
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:25pm MST	Oh shit
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:25pm MST	There are so many more here than in Tucson
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:25pm MST	I'm almost 80% of the way to level 31.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	I've gone up two levels in like 3 days
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	The event right now is ending soon I think but I'm getting crazy xp.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	I'm level 16
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	I finally have someone else to play with
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	It's true Olivia

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:12pm MST	Haha true. Although I shouldn't be that poor as long as I don't spend all of the money Penn gives me.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:11pm MST	Yeah a higher power probably thought you needed some good luck to counteract your imminent poverty
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:10pm MST	I feel kind of bad because I'm sitting here in the breezeway watching the storm but I keep seeing people completely drenched and miserable.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:09pm MST	Right? I got back to my drom like 15 minutes before it started.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:07pm MST	That looks really pretty, but horrible to be in. Thank 2 chainz for shelter
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 1:50pm MST	It's monsoony as fuck here

Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 6:36pm MST	You won't do it pussy
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 6:24pm MST	Do it
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 6:20pm MST	I was saying you guys should peer pressure me into spending an excessive amount of money to buy Scott a plane ticket to Philly for 4th of July. Then Emanuel called me some weird in Spanish
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 6:19pm MST	üçâ

Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 5:57pm MST	That's not that big of a deal though.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 5:57pm MST	I'm sure it'll pay off over the long run
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 5:50pm MST	Currently I pay $3.29 each morning...
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 5:50pm MST	But then I gotta buy a coffee maker and a toaster...
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 5:48pm MST	You can always just make that
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 5:47pm MST	Cause I need my bagel and coffee.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 5:46pm MST	Ok well after I eat this McDonald's no more eating out except breakfast.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 5:44pm MST	Potatoes, rice, chicken. Those are all pretty cheap. Beef is okay if it's on special. Eggs are also good.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 5:41pm MST	Don't eat out is an easy one.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 5:26pm MST	Emanuel I need more of your help. How do you be a poor college student? I have to start saving if Scott is gonna spend all my money. How do I not starve. What do I buy. Help.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:39pm MST	This idea gets better and better.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:33pm MST	And 4th of July in Philly is the dopest shit ever from what I hear.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:33pm MST	You can do whatever the fuck you want
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:33pm MST	Plus fuck it I'm a grown ass adult.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:33pm MST	Perfect
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:32pm MST	And I got extra summer money because of Marc and Penn.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:32pm MST	Plus we didn't even do anything nice for my birthday or our anniversary this year
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:28pm MST	Holy shit. You're so fucking right.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:28pm MST	From an emotional point of view, he'll feel nice that you're willing to do that to see him, and from a financial standpoint, it's fair given that you don't have to pay rent
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:26pm MST	Right? I'm just trying to justify $660 for like 3 days...
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:26pm MST	Life's crazy
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:25pm MST	I'm not sure, but somehow I got the strange feeling that you wanted to do it and you wanted me to pressure you into it
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:25pm MST	I appreciate the support Emanuel. You were always my favorite
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:24pm MST	*escort
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:24pm MST	Spoil him and make him feel like a call girl
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:24pm MST	Fly Scott in
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:24pm MST	I feel like there's significantly less to do here but somehow my schedule is always filled
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:20pm MST	There's so much shit to do here. They have like a million festivals every single week.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:19pm MST	He can do the same shit there
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:18pm MST	He mostly just watches random YouTube videos.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:18pm MST	I need you guys to peer pressure me into spending an excessive amount of money to pay for his ticket here. @Jose @Paul @Daniel @Emanuel
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:18pm MST	What does Scott regularly do with his spare time?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:17pm MST	And he hates his roommate.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:17pm MST	He never leaves his apartment.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:17pm MST	Lol no he hates Phoenix.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:17pm MST	He doesn't like it?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	I'm trying to improve his quality of life.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	Lol but he's so fucking miserable stuck in phoenix
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	Kinda like babyish but it's not restricted to age
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	You use it to describe someone who always wants to sit in their moms lap or wants to their boyfriend to fly across the country to spend the 4th of July with them
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:15pm MST	It's such a good fucking word
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:14pm MST	Lol I figured what does it mean?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:14pm MST	It's spanish
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:10pm MST	What
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:09pm MST	Chipilona
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:08pm MST	I think I've almost convinced Scott to come here for 4th of July.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 3:54pm MST	Same. Everyone from here's has been pretty nice.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	Everybody from Philly dope af

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 3:08pm MST	Awwww shit they're fucking dope aren't they?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 3:08pm MST	I met someone who is from there
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 3:03pm MST	Are you coming to visit me????
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 3:03pm MST	But whyyy
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 2:52pm MST	What part of Philly? Im in University City which is technically in West Philadelphia because I'm on the west side of the Schuylkill River
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 2:51pm MST	What part though
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 2:50pm MST	Philadelphia yo. It's in the very far south east corner.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 2:26pm MST	What part of Pennsylvania are you in?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 2:22pm MST	Que onda

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 11:15am MST	My lab takes safety very seriously.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:44am MST	I like that.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:42am MST	I was thinking it was an elevator that took you to a normal garage on the moon
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:42am MST	Haven't checked it out
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:42am MST	I don't know
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:41am MST	Do they service and repair moons?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:40am MST	What is that?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:39am MST	Apparently they have moon garages here
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:39am MST	Classy af
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:35am MST	This is my classiest dinner to date
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:34am MST	That's really clean
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:24am MST	This is my clean room where I've done my first 110 DNA extractions...Only 136 to go
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:00am MST	I try my best
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:43am MST	That seems perfectly reasonable.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:42am MST	Fuck outside rocks. I want to be completely surrounded by soft mats to fall on
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:40am MST	That's amazing.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:40am MST	Oh shit. When are you gonna start climbing rocks outside
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:40am MST	Yeah it's pretty dope to be fair. Lots of fresh produce, plus they sell like fresh pizza sandwiches and sushi, they're open 24 hours and they have like a 5 story parking garage on top of them.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:39am MST	Here's me climbing a fucking rock
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:38am MST	It's okay. I'm appreciating vicariously through you
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:37am MST	I'm sorry I'm living your dream and not appreciating it to the fullest
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:37am MST	That's very nice. My dream is to live somewhere where I can walk to get groceries
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:35am MST	My grocery store is across the street which is nice
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:33am MST	That's us carrying groceries back
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:33am MST	Those dogs are quantifiably cute
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:32am MST	The computer knows you too well
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:32am MST	I don't know why Facebook is trying to sell me cell culture, but I'm impressed.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:32am MST	Here's some dogs that were at the farmers market
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:32am MST	That's amazing
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:32am MST	Also I've started seeing ads like this.

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:31am MST	That's awesome. New life motto.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:31am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:31am MST	You're like a multi potent stem cell, you can be anything
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:31am MST	I know. Life is so unexpected
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:30am MST	Oh shit. Your career path is so unpredictable Emanuel
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:30am MST	This is the beginning of my uprise a fashion designer. I suggested she wear the flower
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:29am MST	Yeah I'm just outside my dorm, going to go in search of food
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:28am MST	I saw this on a piece of math department furniture
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:28am MST	That's boring. You gotta get out.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:28am MST	That reminds me. I also saw a horse drawn carriage yesterday in Old Town
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:28am MST	This is my life at this very moment:
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:27am MST	I used to send pictures but I felt weird cause I was the only one
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:26am MST	Y'all are terrible at uploading pics capturing your day to day lives.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:25am MST	Very subtle
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:25am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 1:12pm MST	Yeah I was thinking about the Tupac movie. I can't wait for spider man
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 12:57pm MST	Wonder woman was dope, I'm trying to convince Scott to go see it. I wanna go see the new Tupac movie, I might go tomorrow
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 11:30am MST	That should be our inspirational quote for tomorrow
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 11:29am MST	Buy cottage cheese and the rest will follow
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 11:29am MST	Be true to yourself
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 11:29am MST	Well then I guess I shouldn't tell you how to live your life
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 11:28am MST	That's what I do though
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 11:27am MST	I wish Olivia I saw that last week in Tucson. No I watched baywatch. Ridiculous movie but it was fun. And Emanuel don't buy too much cottage cheese.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 11:26am MST	Guys a cottage cheese container is less than two dollars here
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 11:11am MST	Was it Wonder woman???
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 11:11am MST	Jose what movie did you see?

Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 9:53am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 9:51am MST	One of my roommates does her makeup before she goes to the gym
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 9:51am MST	Probably people willing to work out with me but I doubt I wanna work out with them.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 9:47am MST	Do you have potential gym buddies?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 9:46am MST	I have yet to go to the gym since I've been here....I'm the worst
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 9:45am MST	It's peppermint. I'm gonna go to the gym and get extra sweaty so that I can get good use out of it
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 9:45am MST	That's good. Soap is good.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 9:42am MST	I just bought some dope ass soap from a farmers market
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 9:42am MST	Oh yeah that's where I live, in University City.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 9:42am MST	We don't have an old town but we have a college town
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 8:05am MST	It's cray cray. I have to ride the bus for 30 stops, which takes approximately 27 minutes
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 8:00am MST	Well I'll pray for your journey
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 8:00am MST	Oh
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:59am MST	It's not actually old most of it's new or at least relatively new since this whole place is old. But they have a lot of cool gift shops so I'm just gonna go wander around
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:59am MST	Send pictures if you see dope old buildings
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:59am MST	Sounds cool
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:59am MST	An area of downtown called old town
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:58am MST	Where you going?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:57am MST	I'm waiting for the bus...I waited for like 15 minutes before some dude told me the route was detoured so now I'm waiting at another stop
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:57am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:54am MST	Here it was 5.99
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:53am MST	Oh ok they have early bird showings in Tucson too. I think here early bird is like 7.25 or something
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:51am MST	I'm the only one in the theater
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:51am MST	Yeah I am
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:50am MST	Yeah it's cheaper but youre probably also at an early bird showing
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:49am MST	And the ticket was less than in Tucson
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:49am MST	Yeah that's how the theater I went to on Tuesday was.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:49am MST	I'm very happy right now
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:49am MST	I came to a movie, all the seats are recliners
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:48am MST	Unfortunately
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:48am MST	No
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:47am MST	Do you have Uber pool there?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:47am MST	Sorry for leaving all of a sudden, I got into an uber
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:23am MST	Agreed. The weather is super nice though it's like low 70s and sprinkling occasionally
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:23am MST	Freaking extractions
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:22am MST	Yeah but there's literally no way I can finish my extractions in time if I can't get in this weekend. Then the plans are going to get all complicated.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:22am MST	So I'm giving my PI a short amount of time to email me back with a brilliant plan to hack into the building. If not I'm going elsewhere.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:22am MST	It's a sign you should rest not work
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:21am MST	Well Im at the building where my lab is but my key isn't giving me access to the 10th floor
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:21am MST	Olivia do you have epic Saturday plans?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:21am MST	I decided on the weekends humor will suffice. I'll save inspiration for week days.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:20am MST	Lol very true.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:20am MST	That wouldn't hurt Donald Trump much, his hands are so tiny
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 16, 2017 at 7:08am MST	Shits true though.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 16, 2017 at 7:08am MST	Lol you guys left me know choice.
Jose Celaya	Friday, June 16, 2017 at 7:07am MST	Haha I knew you'd do something like that
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 16, 2017 at 6:40am MST	I'm working give me like 20 minutes goddamn
Jose Celaya	Friday, June 16, 2017 at 6:14am MST	We can't do good work if we're not inspired
Jose Celaya	Friday, June 16, 2017 at 6:13am MST	@Olivia you're failing us
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, June 16, 2017 at 6:12am MST	Where's the inspiring morning picture?

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 5:41pm MST	Are you climbing real rocks or are you climbing an indoor wall?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 5:41pm MST	Jk I'm getting wings cause they're 60cents.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 5:41pm MST	That's dope
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 5:33pm MST	I had a beer the first night I was here. And then I had a beer yesterday at a thesis defense party. It's technically like a sports bar, so I'm here for a burger but your dear mother needs a margarita
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 5:32pm MST	*any
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 5:32pm MST	I have yet to consume and alcohol
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 5:30pm MST	Oh thank God I found a dive bar near my dorm
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 5:30pm MST	Guys, climbing rocks is hard as fuck
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 2:30pm MST	I'm getting there guys just wait

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 6:04am MST	No. I'm still listening to Discovery
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 6:03am MST	You listen to random access memories?

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	I mean it really doesn't even feel that hot except when you stand directly in the sun. It just feels sticky and disgusting and gross and uncomfortable
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 2:23pm MST	Yeah I've never appreciated the indoors and AC more in my life
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 2:23pm MST	Gross. Yesterday it was like 30% but got to like 92 or something. So glad I have an AC unit in my room
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 2:22pm MST	I wanna die

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 2:18pm MST	Jesus Christ it's like 50% humidity here. Fortunately it's only like 82 but it feels so disgusting...
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 11:27am MST	Now you can buy 10 crockpots and flaunt your wealth

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:37pm MST	The number I called was 5206211783 it's the bursar's office, not financial aid. They were able to help me pretty quickly. Just tell them you're waiting for a web refund and you want a status update.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:37pm MST	Weird. Mine used to say my address but when I looked today, it was blank, so I had to update it.
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:35pm MST	which are correct
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:34pm MST	nope, just the addresses
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:32pm MST	If you go to uaccess, scroll down to wear it shows permanent address and billing address. Does it say anything?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:32pm MST	I got an email telling me about it.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:29pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:29pm MST	No problem!
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:25pm MST	thanks!
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:25pm MST	ok, I'll try to give them a call tomorrow
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:12pm MST	I think they open at like 9
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:11pm MST	I think you'd have to call the administration building like Olivia
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:11pm MST	How do I check if I have the same problem as Olivia?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 6:39pm MST	Hm, I don't think that's it. I signed up like a week or two before I got mine
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 6:02pm MST	I don't think so, I think I haven't received my stipend because I just signed up for direct deposit like two months ago
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 4:37pm MST	Daniel did you have the same problem?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 4:37pm MST	Oh my god
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 4:05pm MST	Apparently at some point during April, a piece of mail from them got returned so they deleted my permanent address from my file, and they apparently can't process a web refund direct deposit without a permanent street address. So I just had to go on uaccess and update my address.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 4:03pm MST	Porqu√©?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:57pm MST	Wow the u of a is so fucking g retarded.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	Those mother UKs better have your money
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:46pm MST	Sounds like a plan
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:45pm MST	Right? Like WTF. Actually since I have a few minutes before I have to go downstairs I'm gonna call financial aid and ask them WTF their problem is
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:45pm MST	Oh jeez. Someone cursed you guys
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:44pm MST	His cooling system on his gaming PC failed yesterday, so a bunch of his hardware overheated and he has to replace a bunch of it...No bueno
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:43pm MST	Just ask Scott for some money
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:43pm MST	Lol my phone bill and my credit card are both due like tomorrow.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	Do it
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:41pm MST	I should probably eat dinner before I go to the movies. I hear they serve food at the theater but I bet it's expensive
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:41pm MST	Yep that sounds like you
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:40pm MST	Oh they fucking know. I never let them forget it.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:40pm MST	You should have brought your DVD collection with you. Now how is anyone gonna know you're an adult?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	Ah. Well. It's amazing. I even own it on DVD so I can watch it for free whenever I want. Except it's at home lol
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	Not sure what I'll do yet, the night's still young
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	I might be able to find it for free
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	It's $3 there too
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	What about Amazon? I rent stuff on there sometimes.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	*but it's
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:37pm MST	Hm it's not on Hulu or Netflix, buts it's $3 on YouTube
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:34pm MST	Idk if it's on Netflix or Hulu or what...I know it used to be on Netflix.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:34pm MST	Haha let me see if I can
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:33pm MST	I changed my mind don't go see your stupid city stay in your room and watch Robin hood
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:33pm MST	Damn I'm good.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:33pm MST	So I guess he was 19
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:33pm MST	It came out July '93, he was born August '73
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:31pm MST	It has a VERY young Dave Chappelle. Like I'd be surprised if he was even like 20-21 in it.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:31pm MST	I'm looking it up
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:31pm MST	Seriously????? Watch Robin Hood Men in Tights. It's one of my favorite movies period.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:30pm MST	I don't know those
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:30pm MST	It's just my favorite Mel Brooks movie. I think Robin Hood Men in Tights is my favorite, but Young Frankenstein is a close 2nd
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:29pm MST	It's really weird but really funny
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:28pm MST	Seems reasonable I guess? I saw that movie when I was a kid but I only remember some parts here and there.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:24pm MST	I think that's pizza the hut from spaceballs
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:24pm MST	What is it from. I just picked it because it's weird af
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:24pm MST	Haha I love that movie
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:22pm MST	Olivia you have to yell at/kill someone
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:21pm MST	Wow still not yet?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:21pm MST	I have like 47 places to check out once I get some goddamn money
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:21pm MST	I want to die
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:21pm MST	And all the hookah lounges close by are 21+
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:21pm MST	I might check out some places outside downtown during the weekend
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:21pm MST	Eh honestly it's like wet and dirty.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:20pm MST	Something like that. Jose you should go explore your city
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:19pm MST	Actually maybe February
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:19pm MST	I don't think the 5 of us have all talked at the same time since like January
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:18pm MST	We should all video chat together one day. It will be chaos.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 2:39pm MST	Ok hold on
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 2:38pm MST	Down
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 2:38pm MST	Are you busy do you wanna just video chat I can show you my walk home. It's pretty dope
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 2:36pm MST	So is philly huge?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 2:36pm MST	And like a million buses.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 2:36pm MST	Yeah there's the subway which is a train but underground. And the trolleys use the same rails as the subways so they're also underground. And then the L is the above ground local train, but I haven't ridden that yet, then there's Amtrak that goes to the suburbs and to NY and DC and whatnot.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 2:33pm MST	Whoa, yeah there's no subway here
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 2:29pm MST	I haven't ridden any of Penn's campus transit, I've just ridden the city buses, subways, and trolleys
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 1:31pm MST	But the seats are black
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 1:31pm MST	Just like the cat tran

Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:14pm MST	You're gonna have to teach them a lesson
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:13pm MST	And I actually like you. I don't like them.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:13pm MST	These girls don't know shit
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:13pm MST	Cause you know what's good for you.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:13pm MST	I'd be scared to go near you at that point
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:12pm MST	Yeah...Or when it gets to be about 8 weeks into the program and I'm busy grinding trying to get shit done before deadlines
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:11pm MST	If they were just being productive and baking then that would be fine. But four college girls in a tiny ass apartment are loud as fuck.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:11pm MST	When you've collected enough Olivia candies to evolve?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	One day, when I've reached my final form.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	Both scenarios sound hilarious
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	I'd take that too
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	But I'm not yet that strong
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	Old grumpy lady
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	The strongest people tell other people to get out of their goddamn apartment.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	Go sleep Olivia
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	Ok then
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:09pm MST	That
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:09pm MST	Fuck

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:08pm MST	I don't want their shitty brownies. My roommate who has never cooked a single meal in her life is the one trying to make them.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:07pm MST	It'll make up for it
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:07pm MST	Just demand brownies
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:07pm MST	I just got out of the shower and there are 4 girls trying to make brownies in my kitchen...Fucking kill me

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:06pm MST	That wasn't even the scariest part. Here's more pictures of that though
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:06pm MST	You've even got comments now
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:06pm MST	Haha, oh my god that looks pretty terrifying
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:03pm MST	It's even better

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:02pm MST	It's definitely a possibility
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:01pm MST	Do you wanna do VR in grad school now?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:00pm MST	The guy across the hall have two Oculus rifts. I've played a decent amount there.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:00pm MST	You gotta send more pictures

Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:59pm MST	Have you tried out a bunch of gear though?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:59pm MST	Basically
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:59pm MST	Holy shit. Is it like a big room?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:59pm MST	*node is
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:58pm MST	I don't know what a nice is, but it's‚Äã powered by 48 nodes
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:58pm MST	They showed is this thing called the v6 which is 3d. Each one of the quarters of the six screens is displayed by four projector‚Äãs
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:57pm MST	How many papers have you read?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:57pm MST	Not yet. We're doing a whole bunch of reading before we start.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:55pm MST	Hopefully not as bad as it sounds. Are you coding some crazy VR shit?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:50pm MST	That's some hardcore shit
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:43pm MST	There's this pde solver program called flexpde I have to mess with and try to get something working in it by tomorrow. We reviewed stability of Euler's method. But honestly flexpde is gonna take some time, I've spent a few hours on it so far and I haven't gotten far. Also he gave us a packet to review on continuum mechanics.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:40pm MST	@Jose Celaya what stuff do you have to do?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:44pm MST	fuuuuck I have so much shit to do. This week is going to be hell.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:14pm MST	It's basically a bit bigger than the math department in ENR2
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:14pm MST	The math department is pretty small. It's in the science building on half of the second floor
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:14pm MST	Damn. No I should've taken one
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:14pm MST	Oh ok that makes sense
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:14pm MST	Do you have a picture of your desk?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:13pm MST	Lol I meant same
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:11pm MST	Oh and Emanuel why'd you say sand?
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:11pm MST	First day was pretty good. I've got some stuff to do already, and I got a pretty cool desk. But humidity is fucking retarded.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	*papers
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	I've been reading so many prayers
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 2:56pm MST	So how was your very first day?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 2:51pm MST	Sand
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 1:15pm MST	Why don't we have upside down animals in the library?

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 11:54am MST	Yeah but you'll die successful.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 11:54am MST	Elon Musk is crazy
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 11:54am MST	I'd probably die
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 11:54am MST	100 hour weeks huh?

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:44pm MST	Alright. In the name of garbage I'm going to bed. If I remember, I'll still message you to make sure you're not late on your first day
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:43pm MST	Probably
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:42pm MST	Which is probably a bad thing to inhale
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:42pm MST	My guess is it is mold though
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:42pm MST	I'm basically a microbiologist now
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:42pm MST	Don't go up to any old trash can and deeply inhale
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:42pm MST	Will do
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:42pm MST	Ok well when you take your sample make sure you go somewhere where the odor is strong. Like you walk in the room and smell it right away.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	But I have an idea
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	I mean it's just that I don't really pay attention to it
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	I do
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	Have you never taken out the trash?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	But again you don't have any kind of control. How do you not know what normal garbage smells like
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:40pm MST	I mean I guess you can tell me if it's weird or not.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:40pm MST	You need to find a way to quantify trash smell
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:40pm MST	I like in the name of garbage better
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:40pm MST	Yeah but you won't be able to convey any useful information to me either. It'll be too qualitative.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:40pm MST	I meant in the name of science
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	Do it in the name of garbage
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	And I don't really want to ship you garbage
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	I'll let you know how our trash smells
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	Um yeah there's not a good system in place for smellovision.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	I'll keep you apprised
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	I also wish there was a way for you to convey the smell to me
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:38pm MST	Haha, that's cool. I wonder what they'll say
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:38pm MST	Microbiologists love disgusting questions like this
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:38pm MST	I'm gonna ask my lab tomorrow. They're all microbiologists like me. Plus one of them went to NAU and also lived in Phoenix, so I know he's also encountered different garbage.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:37pm MST	I mean it's still humid inside places. It's not like the humidity stays outside.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:37pm MST	Olivia this has to become part of your research
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:37pm MST	That's true
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:36pm MST	Yeah maybe but I would think our bags in different places of Tucson would be different
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:36pm MST	But you said restaurant trash smells weird
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:36pm MST	But maybe it's the humidity difference, which could select for like different microbes and maybe molds, since I know mold tends to have a strong odor.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:36pm MST	Maybe the bags are different?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:35pm MST	The second is that there is something different. I don't think it's the contents because the individual dumpsters in both regions have a similar odor amongst each other, despite them likely having very different contents
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:34pm MST	The first is that our dumpsters smell just as bad but it's a different bad that we're all accustomed to and we've become nose blind to, so we just don't notice it being that bad day to day.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:33pm MST	I always thought trash was the same everywhere
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:33pm MST	I mean, I'll notice if it smells weird
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:33pm MST	I have two hypotheses
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:32pm MST	Ok but you don't have anything to compare it to if you don't know what Tucson dumpsters smell like
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:32pm MST	The one downside of philly
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:32pm MST	But here, they all smell similar to each other, but it's a way worse dumpster smell than Tucson dumpsters. It's like rancid, it smells so bad
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:32pm MST	Hm, I guess I've never really noticed the specific smell. I'll see how trash smells here
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:31pm MST	Idk. Like whenever I go to take out trash in Tucson like whether its my dumpster at home or when I used to take out the trash at the stores I worked at, the dumpsters all have the same smell.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:30pm MST	I think I'll be good. I set like 5 alarms. Sorry about the question, I saw it late and wasn't sure if I should answer. But the answer is yeah, that's pretty weird. Why would all the trash smell the same?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:28pm MST	It's fine guys just ignore my question. Jose do you want a wake-up call or nah
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 5:08pm MST	So idk if this sounds really weird but the garbage here smells really fucking terrible. Like if I'm walking down an alley or dumping trash on the trash chute or even sitting too close to the trash in a restaurant it always smells the same idk what it is but it is distinctly different than any other garbage I've encountered.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:56pm MST	It's kinda like chipotle but much spicier which is an improvement
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	I'm excited
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	You're gonna be so good at adulting by the end of the summer.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	#momaf
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:15pm MST	Gotchu fam
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:15pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:15pm MST	Ok, I'm gonna be prepared as shit
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:14pm MST	That's what I do anyway.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:14pm MST	Buy some drinks and stuff too, or better yet I recommend like the powder you mix in to drinks because remember you're gonna have to carry shit back with you. Small trips are better. Ask them to double bag your groceries, it'll make sure they don't tear while you're carrying them and if you want you can keep them and use them to carry your lunch with you to work then toss them when you're done.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:13pm MST	I'm gonna have to get a lunch bag
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:12pm MST	And in the meantime think about what you wanna do for breakfast and lunch during the week because you don't want to eat out every single day. So think of what you can pack in a lunch that you can make and bring with you (like sandwiches) or that you can take with you and heat up (like microwave meals) and write that shit down on a list before you go to the grocery store otherwise I can guarantee you will forget all the shit you need.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:10pm MST	Lol this is all shit that either we just bought or still need to buy
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:09pm MST	Once I have a chance to talk to them
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:09pm MST	I guess I'll shop tomorrow
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:09pm MST	How do you remember all that? Ok, this is a great list
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:09pm MST	Ok but here's some shit someone in your apartment definitely want to get: Garbage bags Soap (dish and hand soap for the bathroom) Paper towels Toilet paper Hangers Ziploc bags Some Tupperware Aluminum foil Oven mitts Scissors Butter A dish rack (for drying dishes) Sponge Hand towels
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:06pm MST	I'll ask them about that
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:06pm MST	Yeah that's true
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:06pm MST	It's that kind of little stuff
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:06pm MST	Right but y'all don't need your own vegetable oil, milk, salt and pepper shakers, aluminum foil, Ziploc bags etc
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:05pm MST	I assume
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:05pm MST	Well we're all buying our own food
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:05pm MST	Ok. I'm gonna get you through this Jose. I highly recommend you get your roommate to go with you though, so you guys dont end up buying duplicates of shit like my dumbass roommates did
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:04pm MST	We just have to wash them
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:04pm MST	They came with the apartment
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:04pm MST	I believe so
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:04pm MST	Plates and silverware?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:04pm MST	Yeah we have pots and pans
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:04pm MST	Ok. Do you have a microwave, or pots and pans or anything like that
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:03pm MST	I believe in myself
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:03pm MST	But I've been with my mom tons of times
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:03pm MST	More than 5 items? ...no
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:03pm MST	Have you literally ever done that?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:03pm MST	Shit I have to buy groceries
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:02pm MST	Alright I'll get dressed and go. It's on the way to the grocery store, I gotta pick up laundry detergent
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:01pm MST	Yep I'm inspiring as shit
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:01pm MST	But the quote's good enough to stand alone
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:00pm MST	There's no girl talking to you in this one
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:00pm MST	Shiiiiit. Look at you being all inspiring
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:59pm MST	Alright but only because they don't charge extra for guac.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:59pm MST	No I literally live in the green box lol everywhere around here is super safe. My first night here I walked to the pizza place and had pizza and a beer at like midnight and it was perfectly not sketchy
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:59pm MST	Take chances in life Olivia
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:59pm MST	Eh I'd do it. Honestly I'm already slightly homesick, Mexican food might remind you of Tucson. Heck it might be good
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:58pm MST	Yeah but not 4/5 stars from Mexicans....Who knows what the standards are.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:58pm MST	Unless you're scared it's a bad part of town you're living in
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:58pm MST	I'd go there
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:58pm MST	Pictures look good
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:57pm MST	It has 4/5
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:57pm MST	Idk about this
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:56pm MST	QDOBA Mexican Eats 230 S 40th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 (215) 222-2887 https://goo.gl/maps/ciJv47U4rqj
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:54pm MST	The answer is yes
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:54pm MST	Their logo has a neon light shaped like a saguaro....Idk....
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:54pm MST	Am I brave enough to try the Mexican place by my dorm?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:53pm MST	Haha oh my god
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:53pm MST	Nah it's still in your brain. Better check yourself or tomorrow's advice is going to be about letting shit go.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:53pm MST	I guess now we'll be inspired
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:53pm MST	It's ok
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:52pm MST	You murdered the memory Olivia
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:52pm MST	It wasn't a good photo Jose. I'm sorry
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:52pm MST	That was the only copy of that photo
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:52pm MST	Oh my god
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:51pm MST	I'll try to take her advice
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:51pm MST	In fact...
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:51pm MST	She is Jose. That's why I picked her.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:50pm MST	It's like the girl is talking to me
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:50pm MST	Other than the annoying ass cochella girl in the background, shit is true.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:50pm MST	Oh shit
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:49pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:49pm MST	4/5
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:49pm MST	Lol I forgot to count myself.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:49pm MST	And there are 5 of us
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:49pm MST	Hold on I gotta catch this Poliwag first
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:49pm MST	Your wisdom saved me from a middle seat
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:48pm MST	Ok let me find it.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:48pm MST	Very down
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:48pm MST	Alright well since 3/4 of us (sorry Paul) are in our programs I'm gonna give y'all some daily wisdoms.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	Haha, I guess we're opposite
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	So yeah I'll find some people
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	I've been going everywhere by myself, it's awesome.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	I feel weird being alone
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	Oh ok. Yeah my roommates are not very independent so they never want to go anywhere by themselves.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	We meet everyone tomorrow
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	And the other one I didn't talk to much
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	He takes it Saturday
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:46pm MST	But one is holed up studying for the mcat
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:46pm MST	I met my roommates
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:46pm MST	By myself
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:46pm MST	By yourself or with your program
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:46pm MST	Well, at least your caught up now. And yep I'm in a diner called steak and shake rn
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:46pm MST	Yeah. I just took half doses, it worked for me alright. I get to my lab around 8-8:15 so let me know if you want a courtesy call
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:45pm MST	Try to eat dinner by like 6, I think that helps the most. Because I don't feel hungry until it's getting dark, which is super late, but then I don't feel like sleeping until a few hours after I eat and yeah
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:44pm MST	That's 6 am real time
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:44pm MST	My first meeting is 9 tomorrow
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:44pm MST	I've never tried sleeping pills, I'd be afraid to oversleep
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:43pm MST	It's like a combination of jet lag and your circadian rhythm being all fucking confused by the weird ass sunset. I finally just bought sleeping pills and ear plugs
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:43pm MST	I'll just watch Netflix at night and be miserable in the morning
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:43pm MST	It'll be ok I guess
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:43pm MST	Goddamit
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:43pm MST	Good luck fixing your sleep cycle. Mine was fucked up for like 4 days until I felt normal lol
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	We have the same time
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	Shiiiiit.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	Yeah EST
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	Yep
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	Or est
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	Are you on ETS too?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	Crazy bastards
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	It's because it's summer too. In the winter it'll set at like 4pm. Hence why these crazy folks have daily savings time.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:41pm MST	It's because it's on the edge of the eastern time zone
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:41pm MST	You will I'm sure. Jesus. It sets at 8:30 here.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:41pm MST	That's the weirdest thing I've heard
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:41pm MST	The sun sets at 9:15
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:41pm MST	I hope I see more random stuff here
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:40pm MST	That's because it is lol
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:40pm MST	Yeah I've done it before in Seattle. But I would rather pay more money and actually ride the horses. It's more expensive but way more worth it, a lot more fun.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:40pm MST	I feel like the whole town is like a Wild West amusement park
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:40pm MST	Yeah I don't really like tombstone
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:40pm MST	I'd feel like I was in the 1800s
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	Like if you go to tombstone that shit is everywhere but that's because it's touristy.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	I don't know sounds cool
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	But to drawn in a carriage
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	People in big urban areas have never seen a horse in their whole lives.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	Actually yeah that makes sense
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	Because people don't give a shit about horses in Tucson, they're everywhere.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	I've seen them in Seattle too but nowhere else.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	Why don't we have these in Tucson?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	Lol yeah I saw a carriage ride earlier.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	Because why not
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	Horse drawn carriages
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:22pm MST	My roommates stumbled back around 2:30am last night, and I'm pretty sure one of them puked her guts out. Definitely don't wanna drink with them.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:20pm MST	Not with a bunch of screaming children who are outside of parental supervision for the first time in their lives. I don't drink with those kind of people in Tucson, definitely not about to start.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:20pm MST	You've become more hardcore
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:20pm MST	Just asking Olivia
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:20pm MST	Whoa
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:19pm MST	Like an adult.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:19pm MST	Yeah, we have one
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:19pm MST	Because Jose. I am here to work. I am here at an ivy league school, among the top 3.7% of applicants. I can get wasted at home whenever I feel like it. If and when I decide I want to get crunk, I will do so quietly in my room, probably with a bottle of bourbon while I read publications and maybe watch Grey's anatomy.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:17pm MST	Olivia why haven't you gotten wasted?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:17pm MST	I think some of my program has one on what's app or something like that. They just all message each other about getting wasted every second of the day
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:16pm MST	Is it as lit as this one?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:15pm MST	You have a new group chat Emanuel?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:15pm MST	Haha, I'll do that. I've only really talked to one. He seemed cool
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:14pm MST	You need to start a group chat with them
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:08pm MST	I'm pretty excited. I wanna fast forward to tomorrow when we have our first meeting and figure out how everything's gonna be.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:07pm MST	Are you excited?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:06pm MST	There's my magnificent view
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:04pm MST	Pics or it never happened
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 1:44pm MST	*view
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 1:44pm MST	But at least yours has a nice virw
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 1:44pm MST	Yeah my apartment is super tiny
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 1:43pm MST	This bed is bigger than my bed
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 1:43pm MST	I have a desk
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 1:43pm MST	It's not bad, it's a good sized room
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 1:43pm MST	Is it dope af?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 1:43pm MST	I'm probably gonna have to go get food
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 1:43pm MST	Just finished settling in
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 12:52pm MST	So Jose? What it do?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 12:10pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 12:07pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 12:03pm MST	I'm in Indianapolis as fuck
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 10:26am MST	Nah this is boring now I'm gonna go check out the Delaware River pier. Jose are you in Indiana yet?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 9:27am MST	That's dope
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 9:24am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 9:20am MST	There's a real disk jockey scratching prince songs, and like 40-50 year old gay dudes sneaking chugs of vodka. It will be lit shortly haha
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 9:18am MST	Is it lit tho
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 9:08am MST	Yup. I'm at a pride festival but it's entirely too fucking hot to stand in the sun
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:59am MST	I'm an hour behind you
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:58am MST	Almost noon, like 11:58
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:58am MST	What time is it there?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:57am MST	It's the worst. But on the bright side that meal is the best thing I've experienced all day.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:56am MST	That could be a short novel
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:56am MST	That's tragic
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:55am MST	Because I keep thinking it's just gonna be one more day, before I can go shopping for realsies...
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:54am MST	Why didn't you just buy that instead of a deluxe breakfast?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:53am MST	Yeah but I can't even eat ramen. I have no pan to heat water, no bowl to eat it out of, and no microwave for the cup of noodles version.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:52am MST	That's what college is for
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:51am MST	Fuck if I know...Cindy said it should be coming. It showed up on uaccess on 6/6/17, but there's nada in my bank account. And Scott even checked the mail to see if they accidently sent a paper check. I'm so fucking poor üò£
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:50am MST	Yeah there's like a $10 minimum for credit cards so I had to get like the most super deluxe breakfast plate and I'm slowly dying.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:50am MST	Why don't you have any money?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:49am MST	Those sneaky motherfuckers
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:49am MST	It's entirely too much eggs. That's adorable. I wish I had a bowl to eat cereal out of.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:49am MST	Yeah. I didn't realize, but half the plate is eggs under the pancakes. Or hot cakes as they're called here.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:49am MST	I'm also eating breakfast
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:48am MST	That looks delicious
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:44am MST	Lol well its gonna have to last me through dinner cause I'm still broke af
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:42am MST	That's late breakfast
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:42am MST	Lmao no it's a local diner. Much tastier.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:42am MST	I'm eating breakfast as fuck right now
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:42am MST	Is that dennys?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:42am MST	I was young and stupid back then
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:41am MST	Yes but not this time Olivia
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:41am MST	I remembered that when I was there
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:41am MST	Oh my gosh
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:41am MST	#denveeAsShit
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:41am MST	Aw that's where you lost your boarding pass remember??
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:40am MST	Guys I'm in Denver as fuck
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:05pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:00pm MST	*good
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:00pm MST	Goof night my children
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:00pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:00pm MST	That shouldn't have been separate
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:00pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:00pm MST	Will
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:00pm MST	I most definitely
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:59pm MST	Word. Just hit up the group chat when you're bored af at the airport.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:58pm MST	Thanks for the prayers. My parents are all stressing out, so they'll serve as my alarm clock.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:57pm MST	You will also receive my prayers
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:56pm MST	*Jose I will pray
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:56pm MST	It's true. It's late af here, so I'm going to bed now. @Jose will pray for your pilgrimage to Indiana. I'm 3 hours ahead of y'all, would you like a courtesy text?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:54pm MST	I'm gonna have so many fucking skills
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:52pm MST	That's cool. You should talk to him
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:52pm MST	I'm gonna talk to him. I guess I could always have a computer job and get a welding certificate on the side.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:51pm MST	Like one of the Mentor
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:51pm MST	There's some dude here that's a mechanical engineer
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:50pm MST	I don't know what grad programs there are for engineering. I think most engineers who go to grad school get an MBA for managing shit
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:49pm MST	I've considered that.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:47pm MST	I mean you can also be trained as a welder at a trade school, I think there's a certification for it. Welders make decent money too, like $15-$25 an hour I imagine.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:46pm MST	I have the urge to learn how to weld. I think industrial engineer agrees with that.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:45pm MST	I have never heard of that.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:44pm MST	I just took a quiz and it said I should be an industrial engineer
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:42pm MST	Lol do you mean more like an architect then? They build bridges.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	I don't wanna be a civil engineer
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	That would be civil engineers then. They do bridges, dams, infrastructure kinda things. But it's really more of a glorified trade. Very few engineers get graduate degrees. Most get a bachelor's to learn like the math, physics, materials, etc behind whatever they're building, then go directly into industry or government after they graduate
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	*I'd
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	Out of those, is say bridges
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:38pm MST	Um ok that's a little vague lol because thats what most engineers do. What kind of stuff? Like bridges? Airplanes? Lasers? Powerplants?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:37pm MST	I'm not sure. I feel like I should be able to build stuff
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:36pm MST	Like what kind? Scott will talk your ear off if you have any questions. Most of his friends are the same discipline as him, but I know he has at least one friend in optics and one friend in mining.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:35pm MST	I'm considering some sort of engineering for grad school
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:34pm MST	His major is mechanical engineering and his internship is mechanical stuff in aerospace applications, so he's looking for work in either aerospace or defense or something like that.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:33pm MST	What kind of engineering is Scott?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:32pm MST	I'd be fucking stoked to go here. This city is fucking awesome.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:30pm MST	I wouldn't mind going to grad school here
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:25pm MST	Dope af. Apparently a lot of students really like their summer labs and get early admissions, then just visit other schools in the spring just for fun, then go to Penn for grad school and continue in the same lab from the summet.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:24pm MST	That sounds dope
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:22pm MST	For my summer program, if you do well and get a recommendation from the program director and your PI, they'll recommend you for early admissions. Basically you'll submit a shortened grad school application. They'll give you a Skype interview in October, and if you get in you'll get an offer in November. But you still have until April 15th to make a decision, you can still go interview and visit other schools, but it's nice having an offer already in your pocket even before finishing your other applications.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:20pm MST	For grad school?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:20pm MST	So I don't know about other programs, but y'all should ask if they offer early admissions.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:19pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:19pm MST	But I stand by it.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:19pm MST	Lol I typed that before you said I'm smart.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:19pm MST	Yup. I know right?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:19pm MST	Olivia you're smart
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:19pm MST	Holy shit
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:19pm MST	That's 3.7% acceptance
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:18pm MST	Lol 1348 applications. They made 50 offers, and 40 accepted.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:18pm MST	2,347 and 3/4
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:17pm MST	M√°s
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:17pm MST	1000
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:17pm MST	M√°s
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:17pm MST	500
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:17pm MST	Guess how many applications there were
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:16pm MST	I have 9
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:16pm MST	Yeah in the whole program.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:16pm MST	Wtf 40?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:16pm MST	Whoa you guys have a lot of people
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:16pm MST	We only have twelve
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:15pm MST	40. And 12 of them are from the University of Puerto Rico.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:14pm MST	How many total are you?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:14pm MST	Dios mio.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:11pm MST	Same. Only four of us are 21
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:06pm MST	Oh yeah. I don't know about the whole program but almost everyone is 20-21
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:05pm MST	I know.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:05pm MST	Are you the oldest one?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:05pm MST	Wow.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:03pm MST	It's true. I would kill to even have little Olivia and big Olivia as roommates.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:02pm MST	We spoil you. I'm sorry other people are inferior.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:01pm MST	I am. But I don't like any of them enough to adopt them like I did you guys.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:00pm MST	You're too mature for them
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:58pm MST	Agreed. These girls are fucking ratchet.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:57pm MST	We've been playing board games and dancing and shit
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:57pm MST	Y'all are nasty
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:39pm MST	Yeah. I feel like I'm surrounded by high schoolers.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:38pm MST	Lol well that's what's up here apparently.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:38pm MST	Are yours?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:38pm MST	So hard
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:38pm MST	Lol nah
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:33pm MST	@Emanuel is everyone in your program getting black out drunk and hooking up with each other?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:16pm MST	At least we're both introverts
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:16pm MST	That's crazy as fuck.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:15pm MST	We are opposites
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:15pm MST	Hm, mine was INTJ
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:13pm MST	Introvert sensing feeling perceiving
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:12pm MST	What were all of your letters in that personality thing?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:11pm MST	Emanuel I read your blog
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:11pm MST	Yep I'll be in Indianapolis as fuck tomorrow
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:09pm MST	He doesnt leave until tomorrow.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:08pm MST	@Jose Celaya are you there as fuck?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:48am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:47am MST	Just checked in and got a mobile boarding pass. I appreciate the nagging, I hate aisle seats.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:44am MST	Not on Southwest. See this is why I nag you constantly because occasionally I nag you about useful shit that you don't know
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:40am MST	Mmhmm
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:39am MST	I thought that was just assigned
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:39am MST	Thanks Olivia
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:39am MST	Oh
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:39am MST	They start check ins 24 hours before your flight. The order you check in is the order you board the plane, and there's no assigned seating. So if you check in early you'll get an aisle seat or a window seat. If you check in late you get stuck in a middle seat.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:38am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:38am MST	Yep. Download the app. Check in.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:37am MST	Yep
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:37am MST	Ok I'll do that now
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:37am MST	You're flying Southwest right?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:37am MST	You should probably do that
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:37am MST	Am I supposed to?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:37am MST	No
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:37am MST	You checked in for your flight already right?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:37am MST	You can do it Jose.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:34am MST	Or run out of gas
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:33am MST	That was one time
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:33am MST	Ha...ha
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:33am MST	Oh shit. Don't be late or lose your boarding pass.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:32am MST	Tomorrow 7am
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:32am MST	What time is your flight?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:50am MST	Yeah I will, it's just weird, I don't know what she's looking at. It'll probably be ok
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:49am MST	So do that then
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:49am MST	That's what she said first, but then she emailed me telling me to ask my advisor
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:48am MST	Oh ok then it should be fine then. Relax Jose Cindy will take care of shit
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:48am MST	I checked again yesterday and yep it still said I hadn't graduated
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:48am MST	I told her that uaccess didn't say that, and that I didn't apply for graduation, and that my expected grad date did say may 2017, but that it said I hadn't graduated.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:47am MST	What record? Did you tell her all that?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:18am MST	Wanna know something annoying for me? Apparently my record according to Cindy says I graduated in May. But I never applied for graduation, I haven't finished the requirements for my majors, and on uaccess it says I'm not graduated.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:17am MST	Are you serious?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:10am MST	I'm STILL waiting for my fucking money so I havent been able to check out the bars or hookah lounge nearby
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:07am MST	Well I hope Indianapolis has dope hookah lounges
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:06am MST	It's ok I was too lol
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:06am MST	I'm gonna be gone in less than a day
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:06am MST	I'm freaking out
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:03am MST	Jose are you excited???!
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:08am MST	You don't have your own mini fridge dedicated to eggs?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:08am MST	I've actually avoided eating eggs cause I don't want to leave my roommates without eggs.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:03am MST	Your blog is exactly as I imagined it, minus the catalog of eggs eaten daily
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:01am MST	Organized as fuck. I wish I had a blog but that shit is way too fancy for my life.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 5:53am MST	https://projects.vrac.iastate.edu/REU2017/interns/emanuel-bustamante/
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 9, 2017 at 1:58pm MST	Did you guys email Cindy. We're gonna get our 2nd MARC year off to a good start yeah?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 9, 2017 at 11:22am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Friday, June 9, 2017 at 10:58am MST	You guys just can't comprehend my wisdom
Jose Celaya	Friday, June 9, 2017 at 10:57am MST	Oh my god Emanuel
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 9, 2017 at 6:52am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Friday, June 9, 2017 at 6:42am MST	Oh shit
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 9, 2017 at 6:42am MST	Hey y'all don't forget to email Cindy back that info today
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 7, 2017 at 3:54pm MST	Down af
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, June 7, 2017 at 3:53pm MST	We should go @Jose Celaya
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 7, 2017 at 2:29pm MST	Ok, hopefully I can easily navigate the black markets

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 11:00am MST	Jose I haven't met with my PI yet. Idk where she is...
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 10:18am MST	What's your question @Jose Celaya?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 10:03am MST	I'll let you know for sure but I should be done with my PI by then
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 10:02am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 10:01am MST	I can do 11:30
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:56am MST	I'll be done around 11:30 but I can plan to come down earlier
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:51am MST	When are you done?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:45am MST	Do you wanna come by after you meet your PI
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:45am MST	You're the worst.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:43am MST	Maybe my charger and I aren't meant to be together
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:43am MST	Dammit
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:43am MST	Eh, yeah let's cancel
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:41am MST	Speak now or forever hold your peace

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:49am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:49am MST	Sounds good
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:49am MST	Oh ok yeah I can come down at 9:50. Just meet me by all the grass by drachman hall
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:48am MST	I'm meeting him at 10
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:48am MST	Meet at 9:50ish?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:48am MST	Oh it's on Mabel my bad. What time are you meeting with your pi?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:48am MST	I see where it is
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:48am MST	I just got a map
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:47am MST	Mabel
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:46am MST	Ok you know that street your PI's office is on, Warren I think?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:45am MST	How far from where the roundabout was?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:45am MST	It's on the south side of the hospital, where the sunlink goes.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:45am MST	Like 11:30 maybe.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:44am MST	And what is drachman hall
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:44am MST	How much after?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:44am MST	Lol it's a cluster fuck over there with the construction just meet me by drachman hall.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:44am MST	I have a meeting with my PI right at 11 but I can meet you a little before or a little after outside drachman hall
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:44am MST	Well I can still be where it used to be
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:44am MST	Oh yeah dammit I forgot
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:43am MST	The roundabout doesn't exist anymore, its been demolished.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:43am MST	You there then?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:43am MST	I have a meeting with my problem
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:43am MST	I will be at the roundabout at 11
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:42am MST	Y'all ever been to Chicago?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:42am MST	I have to go to my stupid lab and I don't want to....But I'll have my charger‚Äã with me if you wanna stop by.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:42am MST	Also, I have a question for @Daniel and @Emanuel
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:41am MST	That also makes sense
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:41am MST	Lol idk they all say 2 minutes away. My guess is they work just like a bus driving up and down frequently travelled areas and just pick people up and let people off as needed?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:40am MST	You won't care
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:40am MST	But I mean you're drunk
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:40am MST	It probably takes more time to pick you up, since it's picking up other people near you
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:39am MST	I might use it some nights I wanna go downtown and get drunk and not worry about getting lost af
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:39am MST	Makes sense, but you'll only need to uber once right?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:38am MST	It's like a lot cheaper than regular Uber ride.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:37am MST	But yeah google says it's carpooling
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:37am MST	Or they pick you up in a limo with a pool
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:37am MST	Like a car pool but with Uber?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:37am MST	But it's probably what it sounds like
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:36am MST	And no I haven't heard of that
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:36am MST	Buenos dias Daniel how is Wisconsin
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:36am MST	Ah
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:36am MST	Yeah but I already have a keurig here at home.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:36am MST	Are you familiar with UberPOOL?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:36am MST	But if you buy a keurig you'll have coffee forever
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:35am MST	Like if it's cheap and drinkable nearby I might be better off just buying it on my way to lab.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:34am MST	Yeah I probably will also buy a Keurig depending on the state of coffee near my apartment, idk yet.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:33am MST	I don't know what to buy
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:33am MST	Emanuel was gonna buy a keurig
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:33am MST	Psh. Penn ain't giving me shit. But I guess I am getting their entire stipend. I think I'm gonna buy a Crock-Pot when I'm there.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:32am MST	I expect no less from IUPUI
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:31am MST	Youre living the dream.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:31am MST	Well toilet paper I'll eventually have to buy
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:31am MST	No they give us those
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:31am MST	Damn you got a while then huh. Do you have to buy sheets and toilet paper and dishes and stuff?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:30am MST	That's next Sunday
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:30am MST	I'm gone early morning June 11th

Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 5:32am MST	If I take a picture, then I lose the moment
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	Why the fuck is nobody showing me any goddamn pictures

Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 27, 2017 at 7:54am MST	Sounds cool, just let me know where to get them. Another important question, when is the BBQ again?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 27, 2017 at 7:52am MST	But I figured it was the nice neighborly thing to do since they're new to Tucson. Neither of them have been more than a few miles from campus
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 27, 2017 at 7:51am MST	Lol the most danger y'all will be in is from your reckless driving.

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, May 26, 2017 at 2:42pm MST	Yeah. You're old though so you might do some crazy old people shit and come at like 6 am
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 26, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	I'm not sure yet. You know I'm picking you up tomorrow though right not today
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, May 26, 2017 at 2:20pm MST	@Olivia Gorushi when should I be ready by?
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 26, 2017 at 12:59pm MST	Ok, but I'm gonna say I told you so if it turns out to have murderous intentions
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 26, 2017 at 12:57pm MST	No I went in through the garage so I wouldn't scare it off. It's just trying to get out of the sun for a bit
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 26, 2017 at 12:56pm MST	You can do anything you set your mind to
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 26, 2017 at 12:56pm MST	Lol what no you can't shoot bobcats

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 9:19pm MST	I need to send more messages so it scrolls off the screen.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 9:19pm MST	I'm trying to think of something to say but that fucking picture is just starting at mw
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 9:19pm MST	Dammit emanuel
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 9:18pm MST	We all know that side eye is the best eye
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 9:17pm MST	Ok good. I can't handle any more creepy ass side eye

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 9:15pm MST	I have no idea lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 9:15pm MST	Is that from mad men?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 9:12pm MST	I've never made a creepy face in my life so I don't know what you're talking about
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 9:11pm MST	So use your imagination instead lol
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 9:11pm MST	I want to post that picture of Emanuel in that fucking hat with that creepy ass face in response, but I don't want to go find it.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 9:09pm MST	Olivia that sounds very rapey
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 8:59pm MST	Don't lie Emanuel. You fucking love it
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 4:17pm MST	I'm so tired of everyone trying to make sweet love to me

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 3:36pm MST	Lmao why because I wanna make sweet love to him?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 3:34pm MST	Two notes. One, Jose it's &quot;lo que usted diga,&quot; so you were wrong in that. And second, Olivia are you in love with Emanuel? Lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 8:51pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 8:46pm MST	The 50 cent song?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 8:15pm MST	Emanuel they're playing our jam at chuze
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 6:30pm MST	You're goddamn right
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 6:30pm MST	It's not sarcastic
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 6:30pm MST	But it's a little different
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 6:30pm MST	Whatever you say
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 6:29pm MST	Que?

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 5:57pm MST	No cause me and Emanuel are friends, I don't have to speak formally to him
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 5:57pm MST	It's like you don't even speak Spanish
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 5:56pm MST	It's mi casa es su casa
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 5:56pm MST	No jose
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 5:56pm MST	Mi casa es tu casa Emanuel
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 5:43pm MST	Well, that early probably only 45 minutes but still, @Jose is way closer. Or even @Paul.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 5:43pm MST	Alright. You should probably sleep at Jose's the night before and have him take you. Cause you're supposed to get there like at least 90 minutes early. And it's an hour drive from my place lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 5:42pm MST	Lol yeah.

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 5:09pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 5:09pm MST	Thanks fam
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 5:01pm MST	Shouldn't be a problem, but I'm not sure if I can get that twin bed back before Saturday, so you might be stuck on the couch
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 4:59pm MST	It's cool if I stay there until Tuesday for my flight?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 4:56pm MST	I'm down

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:34pm MST	Ok but I'm going to bed now. Emanuel you should come to the bbq
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:33pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:33pm MST	We should all do 23 and me
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:32pm MST	I'll look into it, but consider this: if I take the chromosome test and find out my ethnicity is so valuable, I might have more sperm donors to consider beyond plain old Mexican.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:31pm MST	Psh. My kids won't need scholarships. They can borrow from the bank of Dr olivia
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:31pm MST	If you have documentation proving you're black or pacific islander or asian, I'll consider it
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:30pm MST	I need to maximize their scholarship getting potential by making them have as many ehtnicities as possible
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:30pm MST	You should consider judging me the content of my character rather than the color of my skin
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:29pm MST	Wow. The racism just got real
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:28pm MST	We can't have kids. You'd have to be a different ethnicity
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:28pm MST	I'm still eating kinda shitty but it's getting better. Like half the time it's salad and Subway. But the other half is like...panda and McDonald's lol
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:27pm MST	Holy shit. That's intense.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:27pm MST	I've measure and logged everything I've eaten the past four days
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:27pm MST	Emanuel stop talking about our future. I refuse to have a baby with you.

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:25pm MST	Nah two dogs is enough. More than enough.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:25pm MST	You should take up a side job dog sitting. Then you could have a lot of dogs at your house without being responsible for them forever
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:24pm MST	More than I thought I would lol the house is just super empty
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:23pm MST	But he comes back on the weekends.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:23pm MST	Do you miss him dearly?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:23pm MST	Yeah, this is his second week.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:23pm MST	Did he already leave?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:23pm MST	He is a strong independent black woman living in Phoenix he can manage his own damn butter intake
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:22pm MST	that's what happens when you deprive him of his essential butter
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:21pm MST	Yeah, Scott literally forgot he told his mom we would meet her in wickenburg. He planned it like weeks ago, never mentioned it to me, and remembered today
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:20pm MST	It's a long story, but I'm driving to Phoenix Friday night, then Saturday morning were driving to wickenburg together, then driving back to Phoenix later that afternoon
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:20pm MST	This is why we need doddle polls

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 4:47pm MST	Emanuel does that mean you're coming
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 4:47pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 12:59pm MST	Actually, I think I will apply. All of my research so far has been cell biology.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 12:18pm MST	But maybe I'll email them and see anyway
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 12:18pm MST	I don't think so, it sounds like it's only molecular, not micro...
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 12:18pm MST	Are you going to apply?
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 12:17pm MST	Yes, that's what I was thinking

Jose Celaya	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:24am MST	@Paul and @Emanuel come to the BBQ
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:22am MST	Sweet. Now convince Paul and emanuel they have to come
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:22am MST	Sounds cool, I shall be there
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:21am MST	I thinking we'll start having people over around noon, and grill throughout the day as needed, and people can hang out for an hour or all day if they want.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:17am MST	Oh and also what time?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:16am MST	Who's going and is anyone in need of a ride or place to stay?

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, May 22, 2017 at 12:02pm MST	It was last summer so probably

Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 9:55pm MST	Yeah I leave Friday and come back Saturday night
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 9:54pm MST	One of my friends grew up in bisbee. He sounds like he hates it almost as much as you hate to yuma
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 9:54pm MST	Are you staying over night?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 9:54pm MST	I don't have the slightest idea. It's part of the program
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 9:53pm MST	But why... What could possibly be so exciting in bisbee

Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 12:43pm MST	Rumor has it that if you leave gum out, they'll eat the gum and it'll clog up their digestive systems
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 12:42pm MST	The baskets are gorgeous, baby cakes little üçå is doing well. They ate the daffodils and snoops ate one of the bushes. The stuff along the fence is still growing, but they keep eating the flowers off the plant so nothing blooms.

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 12:20pm MST	If we left at 1 we could probably be back around 4.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 12:19pm MST	Idk my mentor hasn't paid yet. But Phoenix is like a 90 minute drive, and I don't wanna be racing to try to get you back at a certain time.

Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 12:16pm MST	Olivia if I pick you up in my car we could probably save enough time
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 12:16pm MST	Lame. I wanna get back early if possible cause I still gotta go shopping and clean the house for the BBQ.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 12:15pm MST	I'm in lab today until like 3 unfortunately
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 12:13pm MST	We could take my car or yours, I trust yours to be in working order compared to Jose's lol

Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:28am MST	Wasn't sure if that's what you meant, yes I'm down, the alternative is wasting my whole day on Netflix
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:28am MST	I'm confused
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:27am MST	Do you not want to? I mean I could definitely use a navigator/skip master/popo lookout
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:18am MST	Wait, am I going?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:17am MST	Ok. Let me go to my lab lunch at 11, then I'll message you guys.

Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:16am MST	I thought you were being adventurous and going somewhere else in between
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:16am MST	You called it a road trip though
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:16am MST	To Phoenix you dumdum pay attention
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:16am MST	It sounds way better than going to physics.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:15am MST	Where y'all gonna go?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:15am MST	In fact, we should take a mini road trip
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:15am MST	Haha ok

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:13am MST	Cause ohana means family and family means nobody gets left behind.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 9:13am MST	Or you could help me do some yard work during your stay at hotel Narnia.

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 3:10pm MST	Ok good where is that

Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 2:28pm MST	You know I'm #downAF
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 2:28pm MST	Ok, we're gonna have to boil like 30-40 eggs
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 2:28pm MST	And they should be shell free
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 2:27pm MST	Boiled
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 2:27pm MST	What form should the eggs be in Emanuel?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 2:26pm MST	Yeah Emanuel you still have like 230 episodes to go
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 2:26pm MST	Haha Emanuel I'll win
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 2:25pm MST	Yes, the unwanted visitor. I love our code, because it won't ruin it for Emanuel
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 2:25pm MST	Jose we should have that egg eating contest at the barbeque
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 2:25pm MST	But when you watch it the first time it's an emotional roller coaster
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 2:25pm MST	I'm not sure which one you're talking about, I think it's the one with the unwanted visitor. If so, I love those episodes.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 2:13pm MST	Uh oh Jose. I'm on the episode.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 11:22am MST	Sounds good
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 11:14am MST	Ok after 5 sounds optimal, that gives me time to finish it plus do some laundry, we can meet up somewhere, I'll buy you dinner, and you quiz the shit out of me.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 11:08am MST	So we could either do a few hours before then or anytime after 5
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 11:08am MST	I have to be home at 4 for something, but other than that no.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 11:07am MST	Haha ok, do you have plans later ish?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 11:06am MST	Well I just acquired gas money, so just text if and when you destroy those questions
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 11:05am MST	But this study guide is taking me forever...I might just have to study on my own, idk when I'll ever finish these god awful problems.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 11:03am MST	Lol we don't have to go to campus
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 10:36am MST	Olivia, I think I can be there about 1 and stay for a couple of hours. I'm in the process of getting some money for gas and parking, I'm broke af.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 10:32am MST	They already ended. I'm in Phoenix.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 10:13am MST	Jose I'm working on my study guide now, what time are you free today
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 8:45am MST	Emanuel when do your current living accommodations end?

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:42pm MST	That's good
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:42pm MST	You found the clitoris?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:41pm MST	Oh shit we found it
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:41pm MST	We're here
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:41pm MST	It's like a country club
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:41pm MST	Just Google it.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:41pm MST	Jose
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:40pm MST	You got lost in her vagina?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:40pm MST	I think we found it
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:40pm MST	Wtf
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:40pm MST	Fuck
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:40pm MST	Wtd
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:40pm MST	Trying to find prom
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:40pm MST	Jose
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:40pm MST	We're lost
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:40pm MST	Don't fucking ignore me I will fight you
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:39pm MST	Jose I can see you reading it.

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:36pm MST	Jose did you get in

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:33pm MST	Cause you're going to prom you dumdum
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:31pm MST	Just wondering why the advice now?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:30pm MST	Yes I assumed that
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:30pm MST	No just when you have sex.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:29pm MST	Like in general?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:27pm MST	Wear a condom Jose
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:27pm MST	I guess your textbook was right
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:27pm MST	Damn
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:27pm MST	I don't know what the fuck you just said.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:26pm MST	That's six, I kinda understand that
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:26pm MST	For all people, there exists a topic, such that for all things related to that topic, there is a word that describes that relation, such that for all synonyms of that word, there exists a sentence in which that synonym has been used.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:11pm MST	We should get some free coffee from slot canyon.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:09pm MST	I look forward to your arrival.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:09pm MST	Oh shit.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:09pm MST	I'll be there in a little bit
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:08pm MST	Science and engineering. I'm at one of the round tables right when you walk in.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:08pm MST	Where is it?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:07pm MST	@Jose Celaya My textbook says that it is estimated that the human mind cannot grasp the meaning of more than five alternating quantifiers
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:07pm MST	I take it you're not coming to the homework party
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:06pm MST	Thanks fam
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 11:03am MST	You could do it. I believe in you.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:49am MST	I'd like to be pregnant but I don't want to give birth
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:44am MST	Don't get me wrong, I am thankful none of y'all are knocked up. But I feel like if you were pregnant, we could all be rich and famous and wouldn't have to go to grad school.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:39am MST	I think we should just be happy that at this moment none of us are pregnant
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:37am MST	Mostly cause if/when we have a baby, he'll get to pay for that shit which is way more expensive üíØ
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:32am MST	Yeah. Then again I don't make Scott pay for any of it.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:32am MST	Then we differ in opinion
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:30am MST	Yeah I don't think they're the same...
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:28am MST	It's all to protect both of us.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:27am MST	Lol no condoms are neutral. Cause they protect you too.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:26am MST	I'm counting condoms too.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:26am MST	Lol WTF how many plan B's have you bought? It's not supposed to be plan A lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:24am MST	I think I've gone over half of the total money spent on birth control
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:22am MST	Lol what about all the birth control you didn't pay for?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:20am MST	I should be paid back for half of the plan b I've bought.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:16am MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:10am MST	You always have to pull out. Plan B is too expensive
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 9:11am MST	Scott and I are grabbing breakfast then having a homework party in the science and engineering library if any of y'all wanna come party it up.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 6:15pm MST	Same
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:36pm MST	Well your other finals
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:35pm MST	I got a 103 on the 4th midterm, so I only need an 82 on the final to keep my A
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	Which will help you rape your biochem final
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	Nope.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	But just think of it as greatly needed resting time
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:33pm MST	I understand your death wish
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:33pm MST	And now I can't even justify the time I wasted playing.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:33pm MST	Holy shit
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:33pm MST	I hadn't saved the entire 3+ hours I was playing.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:32pm MST	There's a fucking power surge. At my real fucking house. My computer restarted.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:32pm MST	I'm gonna say she steals it
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:32pm MST	This is too much reading. You're gonna have to tell me in person when you see me.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:31pm MST	And you would not fucking believe‚Äãwhat happens next.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:31pm MST	But he's sleeping. So she puts it in the fridge. Then he wakes up.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:31pm MST	Bring the ingredients back to the house. Ghost mom prepares the ambrosia. Puts it in the fridge, because the ghost dad was resurrected before the ghost mom, so he's aged further and he should eat the ambrosia first.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:30pm MST	Then I also read that the only way to fish for death fish is in the cemetery lake between midnight and 6am. So the son takes a nap and then fishes for 6 hours, got 4 death fish. Sweet.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:29pm MST	So I have the scientist daughter go and fish for a shit load of alley catfish, then give it to the son who fishes for a shit load of angel fish.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:28pm MST	Now the death fish was a bitch. I started by having the oldest son read the lure book, turns out the deathfish only bites angelfish bait. Fuck I don't have any angelfish. Read the angelfish lure book. The angelfish like alley catfish bait.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:27pm MST	First the life fruit. Can only be grown by a sim with gardening level 7+. No problem, one of the twins is a scientist. Scoured the city for this special, unidentified seed and found it. 3 game days later I harvest it.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:25pm MST	Then I need to collect the ingredients: one deathfish and one life fruit. These are items I have never seen before in the game so I look it up.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:25pm MST	There's a bit coming
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:24pm MST	The book can only be read by someone maxed out on their cooking level. No problem, my ghost mom spends like half a day reading the shit out of the book.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:24pm MST	So I said yup I gotta feed them ambrosia. So I have to make it. It requires a recipe book that costs like 10k, I'm a baller so no problem. Bought the book.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:23pm MST	Is this what Yeezy would want though?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:23pm MST	Right??? And also it resets living sims back to the beginning of their current life stage. So basically I can make my sims immortal.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:23pm MST	Why don't you feed them ambrosia?
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:22pm MST	N.E.R.D.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:22pm MST	No it sucks that they're eventually gonna die again or whatever. Because productivity is amazing.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:22pm MST	Holy shit
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:22pm MST	So I start reading about sims ghosts online. Turns out there's a special food called ambrosia you can feed them to turn them back into people.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:22pm MST	And yeah ghosts shouldn't die
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:22pm MST	Why does productivity suck?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:21pm MST	But then I notice, the ghost parents are still aging on their age bar. Like I kinda assumed that once they come back as a ghost, they just stay a ghost forever, but I guess they're going to eventually die again? Or something I'm not really sure. But it sucks because my household is super fucking productive.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:20pm MST	I wanna buy Sims more now just so I can have ghosts.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:19pm MST	Ok so now you're caught up to what I started with today. Just adopted the baby, built a third floor for the ghost parents to live in, so it's like the attic is haunted right? Cool shit
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:18pm MST	They do all the same shit except have jobs, so I basically just have them do housework and whatnot while everyone else is moving up in their careers. In fact the oldest son opted to adopt a baby, since the ghost grandparents are able to stay home and take care of him. So now baby Franklin is also in the house.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:18pm MST	That sounds awesome to me
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:17pm MST	That's some true ass love love. True af
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:17pm MST	Can't they fiddle battle?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:17pm MST	Then she dies, he completes the same quest, and brings her back as a ghost. So now I got two ghosts living in my house.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:16pm MST	So mom dad and three adult children, right. Dad finally gets old and dies. Mom is getting old too. She completes a quest that lets her bring him back from the dead as a ghost. So now he's back and he's a ghost right.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:15pm MST	Ok brace yourself, because it's Sims related and I have to catch you up.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:15pm MST	Why do you want to end your existence?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:14pm MST	So I guess I can tell you in the meantime.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:14pm MST	I was trying to tell @Emanuel Bustamante why I wanted to die, but I guess he's too busy to acknowledge my existence.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:13pm MST	You heretic
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:13pm MST	I can pray to whoever I want goddammit.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:12pm MST	Hey now.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:12pm MST	We pray to 2 chainz in this house

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:07pm MST	You'll thank me later.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:07pm MST	Lol only because you're not old enough for procrastination to catch up with you.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:06pm MST	But I guess I'll do it now so you don't call me a walnut
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:06pm MST	And procrastination has served me well so far
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:06pm MST	Hey hey, I only knew a week in advance
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:06pm MST	And ask yourself, should I order the corsage now? Or tomorrow morning?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:05pm MST	Read the first three rules Jose.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:05pm MST	Walnut?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	No, call them tonight you walnut.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	Well, looks like I have some stuff to do tomorrow morning
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	They're at different flower shops. Also the 2nd one doesn't say a price.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	That's good thinking
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	Whichever one you like better, but at least that way you have two options in case it's too last minute.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:03pm MST	So which one?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:03pm MST	I guess that one is ok.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:00pm MST	Cool cool
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:59pm MST	This one is pretty but I'm still looking.

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	Literally every other girl at the prom will have one. She would be the only one without one.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	Alright ignore me Jose. I'm not excited for you anyway
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	http://www.tucsonazflorist.com/prom-flowers/corsages

Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:49pm MST	I could probably still acquire one
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:48pm MST	After all the work Scott and I put into making you look dope for prom.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:48pm MST	I succeeded
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:48pm MST	I was busy trying not to end my own life
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:48pm MST	Dammit Jose.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:48pm MST	I was gonna say damn you are not gay enough to call me love.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:48pm MST	I kinda forgot
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:48pm MST	I didn't
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:48pm MST	Lol*
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:47pm MST	I have not been around much love
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:47pm MST	Lol yes that's why he's getting a tux.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:47pm MST	Oh shit Jose is going to prom???
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:46pm MST	Jose did you order a corsage
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:42pm MST	I'll take the fact that you're writing this as proof that you survived McCann's?
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:42pm MST	Haha will do
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:42pm MST	@Jose Celaya send prom pictures

Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 9:28am MST	Hey @Emanuel, do you have your second exam? And if you do, can I get a picture of the implicit function theorem question?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:35pm MST	Gotchu fam
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:29pm MST	Ok, good. Thanks Emanuel
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:29pm MST	Not at all. But she said one of them would be on the test
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:27pm MST	It's not too bad?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:27pm MST	I'm pretty sure. It's also in one of the homework solutions
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:26pm MST	Are those in the book?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:26pm MST	Don't forget to review the proofs showing that integrals are the same with different parametriztions
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:25pm MST	I still need to review basic shit like continuity and differentiability
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:25pm MST	Well, fuck I mean I guess at least these motherfucking tests will be over with tomorrow no matter how they turn out
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:24pm MST	Some of it. We could not fucking fifure out how to do a fucking basic limit proof
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:23pm MST	Y'all are such good students.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:20pm MST	Did you guys go over early stuff?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:20pm MST	Cool cool
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:20pm MST	They go pretty fast once you you realize what theorm to use
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:11pm MST	Was the homework hard?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:10pm MST	Same for Analysis
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:10pm MST	Maybe less than 6
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:10pm MST	But we already did 2 hours yesterday, so 6-7 more hours
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:09pm MST	*everything up to but not including
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:09pm MST	I did everything except up to but not including logic langs in like 5 hours. I'm going to the library at 4 tomorrow to finish up the stuff for the last couple weeks, I'm probably not gonna go over prolog much, since I remember it pretty well. Also I gotta do some analysis. Long story short you could probably finish the whole thing in 8-9 hours
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:06pm MST	@Jose Celaya how long did it take you to study for McCann?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 7:35pm MST	I don't know if you've left yet but yeah.

Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 1:47pm MST	Cool, I'm gonna do McCann stuff for a while. Let me know when you're down for that. I'll probably be here late tonight.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 1:45pm MST	We are taking a break from analysis shit.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 1:43pm MST	Who's on campus?

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 3:00pm MST	Well, if you decide to join the world, homeworking/Studying/trying to die will probably commence around 5
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 3:00pm MST	But....A nap sounds amazing right about now.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 2:58pm MST	That's progress

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:53am MST	Lol that's weird. She just gave me some grammar shit to change.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:53am MST	I did so idk wth she was talking about. Also, there was no don't color change at all. I had like 4 people look at that shit
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:51am MST	But did you use justified alignment throughout? And why did your font color change?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:49am MST	I had to email her to explain what justified alignment was
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:49am MST	Weird. I still have to do my revisions.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:48am MST	Or*
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:48am MST	Can't remember the exact comment but It was somewhere along the lines of &quot;starting here the spacing is inconsistent and the text seems lighter. If you copied and pasted either paraphrase of show a direct quote&quot;
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:46am MST	What did she say exactly??
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:46am MST	I mean I don't use justified, but couldn't she just do a Google search to see if you plagiarized?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:45am MST	LMAO what
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:45am MST	What kind of human being doesn't know what justified alignment is
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:43am MST	She thought‚Äã I copied and pasted because I justified my paper
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:43am MST	What now? I don't see any emails...
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:42am MST	Fuck that hoe

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 6:12pm MST	I just don't know what to do, like should I feed him?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 6:11pm MST	I morally object to that
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 6:11pm MST	Yeah he did. But then I got the science lab to bring him back to life, but they said it didn't work, and now he's a ghost and he's back in the family!
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	Did he finally die?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 6:09pm MST	Holy shit emanuel. You remember how I told you how I was waiting for that dude to die in my game?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 5:33pm MST	Shiiiiit
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 5:32pm MST	Several.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 5:19pm MST	Is that several or seven
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 5:11pm MST	My brain is on some next level language shit. I grew up speaking two languages and I know sever computer langauges.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 5:10pm MST	I have to take whatever I can get.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 5:10pm MST	It's true, I won't.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 5:09pm MST	god damn it. Ignore that comma
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 5:09pm MST	Sure, but you know in your heart, you'll never be able to beat me to it in person.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 5:08pm MST	I was giving you the opportunity to say it first.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 5:08pm MST	Nope
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 5:08pm MST	Your chance to say that already expired.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 5:07pm MST	What's going on?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 5:07pm MST	Cause that's the Crip side. In your fucking face @Emanuel Bustamante

Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 11:32am MST	How far away are you?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 11:32am MST	You can grab a table if you feel inclined.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 11:32am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 11:31am MST	Ok, I shall await your arrival
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 11:30am MST	Oh ok that's not bad sometimes they get pretty busy on the weekends near lunch time. We are leaving Narnia again.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 11:29am MST	There's a good amount of cars, but like 5 or 6 open spots
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 11:27am MST	Ok. Is it busy there?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 11:27am MST	Haha ok, I'm here now. No not yet
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 11:26am MST	And we forgot something so now we're driving back...We will be there eventually
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 11:23am MST	We're leaving Narnia now. Did she text you back?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 11:05am MST	We should be there around 11:30-11:40.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 11:04am MST	Village inn, speedway and Columbus. I just got out of the shower I'm gonna get dressed then leave.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 10:47am MST	A d√≥nde vamos?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 10:47am MST	I haven't yet, I'll text her right now
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 10:19am MST	Jose did you find out what color her dress is??
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:06pm MST	I'll let you know tomorrow when I find out what my Sims schedule is like.
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:52pm MST	Thanks Olivia
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:52pm MST	Sounds good
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:51pm MST	Ok ask her and if you can get a pic just of the fabric to make it easier to match, it doesn't have to be the whole dress.
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:47pm MST	Ok I'll ask her tomorrow
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:47pm MST	Yes, these are things that come with the tux, you just pick what color you want. I would ask her.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:43pm MST	Wait why must Jose coordinate? Is he getting laid??
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:43pm MST	My budget is like 200 for renting and shoes
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:42pm MST	I think she'll be ok with it as long as I wear something nice
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:42pm MST	Lol yes, but usually you coordinate some piece or pieces with her dress. Like the tie, handkerchief, or sometimes the vest.
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:39pm MST	This is the one piece of fashion I know
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:38pm MST	But I mean a tux is black right? Black goes with everything
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:38pm MST	No
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:38pm MST	Do you know what your friend is wearing??? Like what color her dress is
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 8:54pm MST	Just let me know when you're free
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 8:48pm MST	I don't understand guys.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 8:48pm MST	Idk lol
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 8:46pm MST	No yeah that's cool. Why would I be embarrassed?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 8:45pm MST	Do you want me to invite Scott or will you be embarrassed? I mean I can help you but he definitely knows way more about suits than me
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 8:43pm MST	I'm down for tomorrow
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 8:42pm MST	You should do it this weekend though, like the sooner the better. It's a seasonal thing and alterations take a few days, so places are probably getting slammed right about now.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 8:41pm MST	Ok I am definitely down. I will ask Scott, he's trying on pants right now.
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 8:28pm MST	And I didn't answer you earlier, yes you can and should come and help me get one
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 8:28pm MST	Olivia where do I rent one?
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 8:28pm MST	Haha will do
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 8:09pm MST	Jose please send tuxedo pictures
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 6:54pm MST	I would've been down though haha
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 6:54pm MST	I took a nap lol

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 5:07pm MST	*own
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 5:07pm MST	I don't in any batteries
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 5:05pm MST	Ah ok
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	No Jose I'll get him but you can take him back afterwards
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	Just meet y'all at little Anthony
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	Otherwise we're doomed to the radio.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	@Emanuel Bustamante could you provide me with 2 AA batteries for my FM transmitter
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	Ok Emanuel I'm not getting you?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 5:02pm MST	I apologize for the terrible resolution.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 5:02pm MST	You don't have to pretend anymore @Olivia Gorushi
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 5:01pm MST	I dont want to pretend.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 5:01pm MST	Pretend that was a period.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 5:00pm MST	That would be dope?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:59pm MST	Emanuel would you like me to pick you up when I leave lab
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:59pm MST	I'll inform Scott. I don't think paul and Daniel are paying attention.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:59pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:59pm MST	Good enough for me
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:58pm MST	But I've never ordered alcohol there.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:58pm MST	Well I mean I think they have a few beers and like red and white wine by the glass.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:58pm MST	I could live off of kale
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:58pm MST	Wait nut no booze?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:58pm MST	You could just live in Narnia. It's nice there. Except the rodents
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:58pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:58pm MST	Emanuel you don't have to come back

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:56pm MST	Cause they have bomb ass ice cream.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:55pm MST	That sounds dope af right now. I was gonna suggest little Anthony's if emanuel could survive dinner without booze.
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:55pm MST	I could give Emanuel a ride, or you could either way
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:55pm MST	Oh shit.

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	Where are we meeting up?
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	I know, I should have done it a while ago
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	No
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	No because I didn't register it after I bought it
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	Wait, it's not even in your name yet?
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	I gotta ask the guy I bought it from for another title
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	Don't you just have to renew it though?
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:51pm MST	The title got liquid on it so they wouldn't take it
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:51pm MST	Well no but if we go to illegal Pete's or something you can go

Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 1:21pm MST	I love kale
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 12:58pm MST	I hate it when people delete my commas
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:32am MST	Got you fam.
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:32am MST	Thanks for letting me know to open it in word Olivia
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:31am MST	She said one of my sentences was too long and deleted a lot of commas
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:29am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:29am MST	I'll do that
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:29am MST	Oh
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:29am MST	Make sure you actually open it in word, not just the viewer on your email. Sometimes not all comments and revisions are visible in the viewer.
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:28am MST	Ok just looked at it, I think she changed like two words
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:26am MST	Well I glanced at it, but at first I thought she sent me my original paper
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:26am MST	I haven't looked at mine yet
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:24am MST	Lol well that's good then.
Daniel Osorio	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:23am MST	not that much
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:21am MST	Lol well of course she did, but did she sound mad or anything?
Daniel Osorio	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:20am MST	she said mine wasn't long enough
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:17am MST	Did y'all get the revisions from Cindy? Mine were all super small changes in grammar and rewording some of my longer sentences, that's it...
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:11am MST	Fucking ridiculous.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:10am MST	Kale wins again
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:56am MST	They left your kale alone. They said fuck that shit and went all the way to the next plot and took a fucking pepper plant. They would rather eat a banana pepper plant than your fucking kale.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:16am MST	Yes?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 7:24am MST	Holy shit emanuel
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, April 27, 2017 at 6:45pm MST	Give them one last kiss from me
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 27, 2017 at 6:02pm MST	Emanuel I don't know what you want me to do. The ground squirrels took the other bean plant and now they've marked your kale. I don't think it's ready to harvest but I'm pretty sure they're coming after it next...
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, April 27, 2017 at 12:53pm MST	I'm confused
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 27, 2017 at 12:40pm MST	@Emanuel Bustamante look at that doggo
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 27, 2017 at 12:39pm MST	Fool me once... https://imgur.com/gallery/4Woew

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, April 27, 2017 at 9:50am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 27, 2017 at 9:32am MST	Yes that's Snoop dog lol
Jose Celaya	Thursday, April 27, 2017 at 9:31am MST	So yes
Jose Celaya	Thursday, April 27, 2017 at 9:31am MST	I think that's snoop dog nodding
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 27, 2017 at 9:30am MST	Anyone wanna grab lunch at 12 at cactus grill???
Jose Celaya	Thursday, April 27, 2017 at 9:29am MST	Also Emanuel, I thought I'd reciprocate with more math memes
Jose Celaya	Thursday, April 27, 2017 at 8:57am MST	Keep that attitude and you'll ace the shit out of your finals
Jose Celaya	Thursday, April 27, 2017 at 8:55am MST	Looks like the prayers worked

Jose Celaya	Monday, April 24, 2017 at 10:35am MST	She'll probably grade more on content for the final copy
Jose Celaya	Monday, April 24, 2017 at 10:35am MST	And I think she'll grade on completion mostly, but also read over the paper to make sure you actually put a bit of effort into it and that it makes sense
Jose Celaya	Monday, April 24, 2017 at 10:34am MST	Good luck ü§û

Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 3:36pm MST	Fucking love snoop
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 3:22pm MST	You're so fucking popular emanuel
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 3:22pm MST	Lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 3:22pm MST	I'm hanging out with Jose and you're not
Jose Celaya	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 3:22pm MST	One day
Jose Celaya	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 3:22pm MST	I will
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 3:22pm MST	Also, Jose have you started your paper yet?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 3:21pm MST	Are y'all in the library?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 3:21pm MST	Goddammit
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 3:20pm MST	Olivia, we're hanging out with Scott and you're not
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 2:50pm MST	Nope I wish.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 2:45pm MST	*salsa
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 2:45pm MST	I thought you were making salse
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 2:32pm MST	I was going to make some dank ass pepper spray, but it's too late. They took the last of the tomatoes and the water melon plant üò≠
Jose Celaya	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 2:18pm MST	Olivia why do you need peppers?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 1:06pm MST	#ignored
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 12:52pm MST	Daniel do you still want to study for the ochem lab final tomorrow morning??
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 11:20am MST	Damn thanks anyway Paul. @Daniel Osorio you're my last hope.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 11:17am MST	Kk
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 11:10am MST	My peppers have all been converted to salsas
Jose Celaya	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 11:09am MST	How about science library, I can park there.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 11:01am MST	Let's do one. Where do you wanna meet?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 10:46am MST	Anytime after 12 is good.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 10:46am MST	When are you free?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 10:42am MST	When do you wanna meet up?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 10:42am MST	@Emanuel Bustamante
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 8:30am MST	I figured as much. And I have little hope that emanuel has a secret pepper stash in his dorm. I was hoping @Daniel Osorio or @Paul Acosta Estrada could maybe hook me up with some dope shit
Jose Celaya	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 8:29am MST	I unfortunately have no peppers in my kitchen
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 8:28am MST	I need the spiciest pepper y'all got in your kitchen, preferrably something dried or powdered.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 8:27am MST	Que onda
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 8:25am MST	Alright y'all I need your help.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:02pm MST	Know that I'm sympathetically yawning with you
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:02pm MST	It's past my bedtime I'm going to bed dammit
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:01pm MST	Fuck I can't stop yawning cause we keep talking about it
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:01pm MST	The wikipedia article on yawning is fucking lit
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:01pm MST	You should write a paper about yawning
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:01pm MST	The sympathetic yawn? Animals do that. Shit is weird.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:01pm MST	Also, apparently kids under six don't get they urge to yawn when they see other people yawn
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:00pm MST	You know it
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:59pm MST	Lol ok yawn expert
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:59pm MST	There's no air in there
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:58pm MST	It's not true yawning though.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:58pm MST	What no they dont
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:58pm MST	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fetal_yawning_4D_ultrasound_ecografia_4D_Dr._Wolfgang_Moroder.theora.ogv
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:58pm MST	Holy shit. Fetuses yawn too
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:57pm MST	Birds look weird when they yawn
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:56pm MST	Owls get sleepy too. Here's one yawning
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:56pm MST	*noches
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:56pm MST	I did. Buenas nochez
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:55pm MST	Did you know that owls' eyes are tube shaped?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:55pm MST	I'll pray for you
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:54pm MST	Nothing venomous. Plus a king snake would keep rattle snakes out of my yard. Alright that's my new plan. When I wake up I'm gonna figure out how to bait and trap a king snake.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:53pm MST	No not a rattle snake. Just like a king snake or a corn snake or some shit.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:53pm MST	Your dogs though
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:52pm MST	*put
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:52pm MST	I should just out a fucking snake out there!
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:51pm MST	Idk. I mean I hear them at night but idk where they are. The only time I actually see them is on the power lines or flying at my car at night.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:51pm MST	You're welcome
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:51pm MST	Make an owl playlist on spotify
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:50pm MST	Heyyyyy now we're getting creative.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:50pm MST	I dunno. Is there any trees where the owls could live?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:50pm MST	Just have a recording of owl sounds playing
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:50pm MST	Yeah so shouldnt I have owls already?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:49pm MST	You've already attracted the rodents though
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:49pm MST	Hm that sound counter productive. Attract rodents to attract owls to eat the rodents.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:48pm MST	Basically have plants that attract rodents, providing a place for them to live.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:47pm MST	I didn't think about dry ice, that's a good idea. Or maybe some vinegar or something
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:46pm MST	Lol how do you attract owls??? That sounds hardcore.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:37pm MST	Traps, poison, putting dry ice in the tunnels, attracting predators (owls)
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:35pm MST	That link isn't working for me. What does it say
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:35pm MST	Lol we already have owls, idk if they go in my yard but they're definitely in the neighborhood. I've seen them lots of times, and I hear them hooting most nights.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:35pm MST	Owls though
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:34pm MST	I don't wanna use poisosnllns or snap traps because and snoops gets into the garden...
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:34pm MST	Fuck butterflies. We need owls in your garden,
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:34pm MST	http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-Moles-in-Your-Lawn
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:33pm MST	I set the trap in the garden by one of their mounds so I'll check in the morning if I caught any. But beyond that, there's poisons, snap traps, and gas.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:33pm MST	Idk maybe buy more of that repellant and put it inside the plots and around the plants. I already used one whole bottle but it seems to be working so maybe I just need more.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:31pm MST	What can you do?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:31pm MST	Yup. We haven't had any packrats in the garden for a couple days now. But the moles are digging straight up into the garden, so they're not even encountering the repellant, I poured the repellant around the garden as a perimeter to keep stuff out.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:30pm MST	Did you sprinkle that one shit?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:27pm MST	They tried taking the tomato plant...But it wouldn't fit down the hole. Part of it is still there, maybe it'll recover, idk. They already took the cucumber and canteloupe plants. The only intact plant in the back plot is the water melons üò≠
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:25pm MST	What else did they take?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:11pm MST	@Emanuel Bustamante if these fucking moles take one more of my goddamn plants I'm gonna gas the fuck out of them.
Daniel Osorio	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 7:18pm MST	hah ok
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 7:17pm MST	Lol if it doesn't say it on the paper I ain't fucking doing it.
Daniel Osorio	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 7:16pm MST	does anyone know if the marc paper needs to have an abstract?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:17pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:17pm MST	Exactly
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	write(&quot;Oh yeah, I forgot&quot;), nl, !.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:15pm MST	Haha, ok no problem. And yeah, but we're doing prolog, I should've written \+ t' = 0
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:14pm MST	It's very nice to be a computer science and math major because we already have notation to type math
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:14pm MST	Oh. I wrote t' != 0 twice. That's why the looked the same
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:12pm MST	Looks like the only difference is that t' &gt; 0 everywhere but finitely many places instead of t' != 0 everywhere but finitely many places. And I guess that makes the absolute value bars go away. Makes sense, since in the first case t' could be negative almost everywhere.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:06pm MST	Let me see
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:06pm MST	Do you understand how 3 and 8 are different on the analysis homework?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:06pm MST	What is up
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:05pm MST	Yep
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:05pm MST	@Jose
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:07am MST	Nevermind.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:04am MST	Are you even actually Japanese?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:04am MST	I don't care as long as I eat it out of a ramen bowl.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:03am MST	I usually eat it at my house. But I imagine I could make it at other peoples houses too.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:54am MST	Do you guys know any good places to eat ramen?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:39am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:35am MST	So tomorrow sound ok?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:35am MST	Yeah, just two more weeks though
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:33am MST	Fucking analysis
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:33am MST	Same
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:31am MST	I could probably do today if you can't, I still gotta finish analysis though
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:30am MST	I'm down, would you be up to meet tomorrow though?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:29am MST	Jose do you still wanna finish the project this weekend?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:29am MST	I wish.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:20am MST	Damn. I thought you expelled your sinus infection already
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:19am MST	That stupid paper
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:19am MST	Lol what
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:19am MST	How gross
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 8:46am MST	I want to die a lot lol
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 8:45am MST	Due on Monday, I want to die a little bit
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 8:45am MST	Eventually yeah
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 8:45am MST	Olivia you getting drunk to write your paper?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 8:45am MST	Quite lame
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 8:36am MST	Lame......
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 8:06am MST	They'd definitely find out at u of a
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 8:05am MST	I doubt they'd find out about pima
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 8:05am MST	Lol no at u of a
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 8:00am MST	At Pima?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 7:20am MST	Y'all think Cindy and Dr. Tischler would probably find out if I enrolled in an online summer class???
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 10:10pm MST	I know. But the relief is real
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 10:09pm MST	That's some nasty ass shit
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 10:03pm MST	And on that disgusting note I'm going to bed. I will pray for your sinuses.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 10:03pm MST	Ignore the guy with the black mucus, he had sinus surgery, but any of the pics with mucus in the hands or tissues is pretty accurate.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 10:02pm MST	https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-android-hms-tmobile-us&amp;biw=412&amp;bih=370&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=TeP6WMukNMH4jwO8-Jv4BQ&amp;q=sinus+infection+bloody+mucus&amp;oq=sinus+infection+blood&amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-img.1.4.0l5.6663.7899.0.10824.6.6.0.0.0.0.885.3279.2-1j2j0j1j2.6.0....0...1c.1j4.64.mobile-gws-img..0.6.3275...0i67k1.WSO1vPeixsY#imgrc=_
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:57pm MST	Basically it's just a little cup with a long spout that fits snug in your nostril and your pour warm water with salt and baking soda up your nostrils. It feels good afterwards because it soothes your raw nasal passages, but it also helps loosen any giant globs.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:56pm MST	I highly recommend one. They're cheap, and honestly you could probably make/find something with a similar function. The packets that you put in it are just baking soda and salt, so you don't HAVE to buy one.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:54pm MST	No. Should i get one?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:54pm MST	Do you have a Netty pot?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:54pm MST	I'm so fucking excited
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:53pm MST	And you will breathe like you've never breathed before.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:53pm MST	I've had it happen the next day, or even up to 2 weeks later, but you'll be blowing your nose and then a massive glob will come out of your nostril, like stringy and bloody as fuck with a hard center. It'll just keep coming and coming out of your nose, basically it's just this huge cluster of white blood cells and dead bacteria
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:53pm MST	As long as it stops, I don't give a fuck
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:51pm MST	This is gonna sound gross, but for every sinus infection I've had, there's only one possible outcome. You get mostly better, like your fever goes away and you stop feeling like shit but you're still hella congested on one side.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:49pm MST	Ok. So here's what's up.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:49pm MST	God fucking dammit
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:49pm MST	Yeah on the left side, which is the crip side
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:48pm MST	Alright. And you're still at least somewhat congested, at least on one side?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:46pm MST	Yes
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:40pm MST	But a sinus infection could definitely cause pressure to build up and you might just feel it in your ear. Is this your first sinus infection?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:39pm MST	Thanks, Dr. Olivia
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:39pm MST	Hmmm it sounds like sinuses, not an ear infection. Ears don't really have a direct connection between each other cause of you know your brain in the way.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:35pm MST	Switched
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:35pm MST	It switched from one side to the other, or it started on one side but then both sides started hurting?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:34pm MST	Yesterday it was on one side, but today it's on this side and more painful.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:33pm MST	And it's just on one side or both?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:33pm MST	MY finger cannot reach where it hurts
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:32pm MST	No I've never had that. Does it hurt like inside your ear like where your finger can reach or like deeper like where your temple is?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:31pm MST	Mine hurts like a motherfucker
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:31pm MST	Did your ear ever hurt?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:31pm MST	Not to my knowledge no, but I've had sinus infections.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:31pm MST	Have you had an ear infection before?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:30pm MST	(This is me trying to keep the group chat alive since nobody has said anything all day)
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:30pm MST	Are you okay?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 4:45pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 4:15pm MST	Hey Emanuel, I actually left early today, I'm not on campus. So I won't be working on it today.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 3:21pm MST	@Jose, are you gonna be working on analysis today?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 11:53am MST	Lol I feel like that would apply to a variety of garden pests.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 11:12am MST	Apparently you can gas em
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 10:21am MST	I have no idea I've never dealt with moles.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 10:13am MST	How do we kill them?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 10:08am MST	I know. I think it might be moles though, not packrats. They dug up from underground...
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 10:00am MST	That's so fucking rude
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 9:58am MST	Yup...
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 9:57am MST	THe whole fucking thing?

Jose Celaya	Tuesday, April 18, 2017 at 8:58pm MST	Only if the rat slaps him in the face with a glove first, and then Scott defends his honor
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, April 18, 2017 at 8:58pm MST	Scott wants to know if he fights the packrat without a gun, 1v1 with no weapons, is that still murdery?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, April 18, 2017 at 8:54pm MST	Yeah...The first one we caught wasn't as lucky. It was in the trap but then remi opened the trap and got it.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, April 18, 2017 at 8:53pm MST	If he eats it afterwards he can kill it

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 12:17pm MST	I have to finish some homework at your house.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 11:33am MST	Downloading shit takes forever, but streaming is usually ok
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 11:17am MST	How shitty is your wifi?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 11:14am MST	I have nothing else I want to contribute to this conversation
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 11:12am MST	Yeah it's not like I'll stop liking dick as soon as we switch bodies.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 11:10am MST	That's not as bad
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 11:10am MST	That means you're gay while you're me.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 11:06am MST	Oh yeah well I would take it up the butt while I was you.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 11:06am MST	By black guys
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 11:05am MST	To get back at you, I'd volunteer to be gangbanged
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 11:03am MST	I think I probably could, but definitely wouldnt.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 11:00am MST	I see
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 10:58am MST	And so she would knock up a lot of people
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 10:58am MST	Basically Olivia didn't think she could pull off pulling out right away
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 10:57am MST	You weren't there for the &quot;what if Emanuel and Olivia switched bodies&quot; conversation?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 10:57am MST	What
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 10:54am MST	If you can pull out with your car, then you can pull out if we switch bodies.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 9:53am MST	You pull out?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 9:47am MST	I always leave mine really far out
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 9:47am MST	Yeah most people that drive them are stupid. But that isn't the fault of the mini.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 9:46am MST	Oh cause they're pulled to far in and make you think there's a spot?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 9:45am MST	I mean parking garage
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 9:45am MST	Well yeah they're not designed to be worked on outside of a specialized shop
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 9:44am MST	They're all pieces of shit in the garage
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 9:43am MST	But when it comes to minis you can go fuck yourself.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 9:43am MST	Hating fiats is acceptable and even encouraged.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 14, 2017 at 9:42am MST	Fuck you paul.

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	It's the 25th. But I am down to accept the 24th.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 3:08pm MST	Well she insists that 10 days before May 5th is April 24
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 2:59pm MST	True
Jose Celaya	Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 2:49pm MST	That would be stupid
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 2:47pm MST	Unless she meant business days

Jose Celaya	Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 2:39pm MST	It just says 10 days before finals start
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 2:38pm MST	How sure are you about the april 25 date?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 2:38pm MST	So should we send separate emails?

Jose Celaya	Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 2:37pm MST	We could complain
Jose Celaya	Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 2:37pm MST	I mean
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 2:36pm MST	Now she's saying April 21st, which is even shittier because it's a Friday, so we have one less weekend to do it...
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 2:35pm MST	She said on the paper the penultimate draft was due 10 days before finals commence. We counted, that would be April 25th.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 1:51pm MST	What?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 1:49pm MST	Idk if she means 10 business days or some shit. That's the only thing I can think of. Fucking ridiculous.

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 7, 2017 at 3:55pm MST	Scott says they are fakes, people crush the actual pills, cut them and re-stamp them. Actually pacmans have are shaped like pacman with a notch in the side.

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 7, 2017 at 3:41pm MST	Yeah it sounds extremely unpleasent from every account ive heard, salvia at least. I dont think I know anyone whose used peyote.

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 7, 2017 at 3:37pm MST	It didnt used to be, they used to sell peyote and salvia at smoke shops, like over the counter
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, April 7, 2017 at 3:36pm MST	Okay lol and I'm pretty sure it's illegal now, like shrooms
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 7, 2017 at 3:35pm MST	Also, I thought peyote was legal? Is it not anymore?

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 7, 2017 at 3:23pm MST	Also, he shared his only ecstasy babysitting experience and it was pretty unpleasent haha

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, March 23, 2017 at 11:02am MST	Lol I disagree with it too, but im pretty sure the consequences of having a fake id are worse than just under age drinking
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, March 23, 2017 at 11:01am MST	Our current legal drinking age is stupid, so i don't discourage fake IDs

Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 1:17pm MST	2 copies for $65. Message the &quot;Hank (dodgers)&quot; guy if you want one
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 1:16pm MST	I will definitely look into that
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 1:15pm MST	Oh shit.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 1:14pm MST	Jose the chat i added you to can also get you a fake ID. Just thought I'd let you know
Daniel Osorio	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 10:12am MST	ok
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 10:02am MST	Yeah, I just parked, im on my way to the science and engineering library
Daniel Osorio	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 9:54am MST	Olivia, did you finish the report?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:42am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:42am MST	Ok awesome. Thanks!
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:41am MST	Mine was a little over a page, and I think I had 6 sources. 2 in favor, 2 against, and 2 neutral/discussing alternatives to animal testing.
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:40am MST	Ok a couple more questions, how long was yours and how many sources did you have?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:27am MST	Im doing mine on animal testing, so yeah pretty much
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:24am MST	You should write your paper on the ethics of killing dogs for research. And Paul should do it on giving mice cancer
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:23am MST	Yeah, its pretty amazing. But most stem cells are culuturable, just like my cells. So im using canine epithelial kidney cells, but its not like I have to go out and kill a dog, I just grow more cells.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:22am MST	You should ask daniel, hes probably more familiar with it than I am
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:22am MST	Emanuel would like them. It's like they're cheating the system
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:21am MST	Apparently they're like the way of the future. It involved taking regular cells and tricking them into un differentiating themselves back into stem cells. Its pretty dope
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:20am MST	They sound like part of the plot to a cool sci fi film. I will definitely check them out
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:20am MST	I remember in my biotech class we talked A LOT about pluripotent stem cells, you should check those out
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:19am MST	Yeah maybe haha
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:19am MST	Let's hope Cindy doesn't know what they are
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:18am MST	Haha yeah I guess im just saying theres not a whole lot of controversy anymore except from people who dont understand what stem cells are
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:18am MST	But 1% though
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:18am MST	Shhhh
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:17am MST	Because like &gt;99% of stem cells used in research now dont come from babies
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:17am MST	Yeah definitely. They're journal articles
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:17am MST	Yeah but make sure they're credible
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:17am MST	There's a lot of articles on it
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:17am MST	Lol
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:17am MST	I decided to be lazy and do it on stem cell research
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:16am MST	Longer than I expected yeah. It was just hard finding credible sources. What are you doing yours on?
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:16am MST	Did yours take a long time?
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:16am MST	Yes
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:15am MST	Omg have you started it yet?
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:15am MST	Not yet
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:15am MST	I will in a bit
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:15am MST	I didnt ask, I just submitted it and said sorry for the late submission. Did you turn yours in???
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:15am MST	So Olivia, what did Cindy say? Is she giving us Bs?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 2:42pm MST	Alright yall im submitting my out line now...did you guys send yours already?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, March 17, 2017 at 6:00pm MST	I havent really decided yet...I doubt it but maybe

Daniel Osorio	Friday, March 17, 2017 at 5:14pm MST	Olivia, did we get any yield for the chem lab?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 11:14pm MST	Crap now that song is stuck in my head
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 11:10pm MST	These are so weird.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 10:56pm MST	Im also trying to remember which ones ive already shown you, cause I aint about that duplicate life
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 10:51pm MST	I want more
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 10:50pm MST	I got memes for days, let me know when youve had enough

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 10:39pm MST	Olivia I'm in need of dank memes
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 8:27pm MST	I think you just have to know people.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 6:18pm MST	Too bad theres no app for that
Jose Celaya	Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 5:43pm MST	Guys how I do find a house party?

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, March 15, 2017 at 2:04pm MST	But spring break
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, March 15, 2017 at 2:04pm MST	Ok, I was feeling like shit for not doing it
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, March 15, 2017 at 2:03pm MST	I kind of thought about it, which I guess is something
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, March 15, 2017 at 2:03pm MST	Not exactly
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, March 15, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	Have you?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, March 15, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	Has anyone done it yet?

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, March 8, 2017 at 8:56am MST	üçâ
Daniel Osorio	Wednesday, March 8, 2017 at 8:56am MST	True
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, March 8, 2017 at 8:53am MST	Daniel's gonna accept Madison soon if Washington doesn't answer
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, March 8, 2017 at 8:52am MST	Alright well thats two of us. Now we just gotta see where Paul and Daniel accept offers for
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, March 8, 2017 at 8:51am MST	And honestly, the only place I would've taken over these two is MIT, and they weren't gonna answer in time
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, March 8, 2017 at 8:51am MST	Well, it's that the research at IUPUI is much more in line with what I'm doing. I looked at some past posters at Notre Dame, and honestly they looked kinda boring. I didn't want to end up losing out and doing boring research.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, March 8, 2017 at 8:50am MST	Or at least sit on the notre dame offer to see if you get more?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, March 8, 2017 at 8:49am MST	What??? Why no Notre dame?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, March 8, 2017 at 8:43am MST	Well...just accepted IUPUI

Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, March 7, 2017 at 7:20pm MST	Et tu math?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, March 7, 2017 at 7:19pm MST	#betrayal
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, March 7, 2017 at 7:19pm MST	I thought math was my friend until now
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, March 7, 2017 at 7:19pm MST	That's exactly why you should be furious
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, March 7, 2017 at 7:19pm MST	Haha
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, March 7, 2017 at 7:19pm MST	If Haskell wasn't based on math, I'd be furious
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, March 7, 2017 at 7:19pm MST	Oh my gosh, I'm not far in, and I'll probably have to take a late day. But hey, we only have two more assignments after this.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, March 7, 2017 at 7:18pm MST	I've been stuck on that part for a week
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, March 7, 2017 at 7:17pm MST	Fucking Haskell
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, March 7, 2017 at 7:17pm MST	I just realized what I did wrong. I was try to do GCD x y but I was typing GCD(x,y)
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, March 7, 2017 at 7:11pm MST	I haven't, but you wouldn't need integers for this assignment would you? Since those are only for big numbers.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, March 7, 2017 at 7:07pm MST	?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, March 7, 2017 at 7:07pm MST	Jose, have you run into Haskell wanting Ints, not Integers
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, March 7, 2017 at 2:51pm MST	Thanks
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, March 7, 2017 at 2:50pm MST	Tricia Serio
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, March 7, 2017 at 2:50pm MST	What was the presenters name yesterday?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, March 6, 2017 at 1:35pm MST	Fuck you then
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 6, 2017 at 1:35pm MST	Here for another 20

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 6, 2017 at 8:26am MST	How long do you have to decide for notre dame?
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 6, 2017 at 8:26am MST	I don't wanna die
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 6, 2017 at 8:25am MST	Well of those two, close to Chicago is way better.
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 6, 2017 at 8:25am MST	Yep, either close to Indianapolis or close to Chicago
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 6, 2017 at 8:25am MST	So your choices are Indiana and indiana?
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 6, 2017 at 8:25am MST	An hour from Chicago
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 6, 2017 at 8:24am MST	South bend Indiana
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 6, 2017 at 8:24am MST	Where is notre dame?
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 6, 2017 at 8:24am MST	Now I have a choice and I'm not sure
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, March 6, 2017 at 8:24am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Monday, March 6, 2017 at 8:24am MST	Just got the acceptance email from notre dame
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, March 5, 2017 at 7:05pm MST	Lol I always just make them up. Like what color my solution was, the temperature, how long each step took, that kinda crap
Daniel Osorio	Sunday, March 5, 2017 at 6:27pm MST	I just have trouble with the observations because I never know what we're supposed to include
Daniel Osorio	Sunday, March 5, 2017 at 6:27pm MST	I'm almost done

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, March 5, 2017 at 6:03pm MST	.10g mg ok and how many mL of bromobenzene?
Daniel Osorio	Sunday, March 5, 2017 at 6:02pm MST	I used 0.10 g as in the lab manual because I was too lazy to make the calculations again
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, March 5, 2017 at 6:01pm MST	Haha thats ok. Ill make sure which ones are limiting.
Daniel Osorio	Sunday, March 5, 2017 at 6:01pm MST	ohh yeah that's right, sorry I just woke up and I'm not fully awake
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, March 5, 2017 at 6:00pm MST	üçâ

Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, March 1, 2017 at 9:53am MST	Olivia, what does that have to do with me? Haha
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, March 1, 2017 at 9:52am MST	Theres probably way more applications to the NIH than UPenn, which makes it more competitive.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, March 1, 2017 at 9:52am MST	So part of it is probably volume
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, March 1, 2017 at 9:52am MST	*feds
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, March 1, 2017 at 9:52am MST	I got rejected by the feos but accepted by the ivy league
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, March 1, 2017 at 9:51am MST	Yeah but heres what im thinking.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, March 1, 2017 at 9:50am MST	I got turned down by Ohio State , which I guess was part of the 10 school application I did. But if Ohio turned me down, that doesn't give me a lot of hope for anything else ...

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 2:54pm MST	Old lady
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 2:53pm MST	Ill meet you guys there at 5, im taking a nap at home
Daniel Osorio	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 2:53pm MST	Where did you park?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 2:34pm MST	Where do I pick you up?
Daniel Osorio	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 2:29pm MST	great, thanks
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 2:25pm MST	I can take you
Daniel Osorio	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 2:23pm MST	Yes, I do
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 2:19pm MST	Daniel do you need a ride there?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 1:37pm MST	Every day usually, or at least every other day
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 1:37pm MST	How often do you feed your cells ?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 1:20pm MST	Yeah but its exactly what happens if your tight junctions arent fully developed. Premature babies dont have fully matured intestine, so they're predisposed.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 1:13pm MST	That's both sad and gross
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 1:05pm MST	If you want an example with pictures, look up necrotizing enterocolitis, its a disease with compromised tight junctions in pre mature babies.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 1:03pm MST	Probably help us understand more about the barrier function in intestinal epithelia, and therefore understand diseases that effect that barrier
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 1:01pm MST	Just one thing, what will knowing tight junction assembly and regulation allow you to do? Like will it help with drug delivery, medical devices, etc?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 1:01pm MST	Yup
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 1:00pm MST	Gracias
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 12:59pm MST	Awesome
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 12:59pm MST	Ok Paul how is that
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 12:51pm MST	Asistir√©
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 12:46pm MST	Yeah gimme a minute, im almost done in my lab
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 12:39pm MST	Olivia , can you send me your tasks and the overall goal of the project ?
Jose Celaya	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:53am MST	Sounds good, I'm parked in cherry, we can head over at 5
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:52am MST	A ride would be dope.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:36am MST	Or nobody is gonna get to eat dinner
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:36am MST	You kids need to calm the fuck down
Jose Celaya	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:31am MST	I'll fight you Paul
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:30am MST	Fuck you
Jose Celaya	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:28am MST	So tilted kilt at 5? Anyone need/want a ride?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:27am MST	Tilted kilt is dope.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:27am MST	Yeah and I dont like sushi
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:21am MST	I'm just slightly more inclined to something with a bar
Daniel Osorio	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:20am MST	that works too
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:17am MST	What about tilted kilt ?
Jose Celaya	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:16am MST	Yeah, but this place is like 5 mins from there
Daniel Osorio	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:16am MST	nevermind that's on broadway
Jose Celaya	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:16am MST	It's called kazoku
Daniel Osorio	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:15am MST	I do, is it sushi garden?
Jose Celaya	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:13am MST	Daniel do you like sushi? Paul showed me and Emanuel this place on speedway a while back and it's pretty good.
Daniel Osorio	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:13am MST	Anything that is edible literally
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:03am MST	Haha what kind of food do you feel like eating??
Daniel Osorio	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 10:02am MST	I don't know many places, do you have somewhere in mind?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 9:55am MST	5 sounds good
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 9:47am MST	I'm not free until 5...

Daniel Osorio	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 9:04am MST	I can go anytime after 2:00
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:55am MST	Ok lets go today, I mean what time
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:55am MST	Lol
Daniel Osorio	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:55am MST	I can go anyday
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:54am MST	You shut your buttlicking whore mouth emanuel
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:54am MST	It was just your birthday. You don't have to read Olivia's messages if you don't want to.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:54am MST	Where/when do you wanna go
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:53am MST	Its ok I figured that it got lost in the other messages
Daniel Osorio	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:52am MST	ohh sorry I didn't see your message
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:39am MST	Daniel
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:14am MST	Yall are ridiculous
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:14am MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:14am MST	Oh. I get it now. Thanks.
Jose Celaya	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:11am MST	Well, only if the maximal proteins are continuously differentiable.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:10am MST	Didn't we have that the second fundamental theorem only applies on a kinase domain if and only if amino acids are the coefficients of homogenous polynomials?
Jose Celaya	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:08am MST	Oh shit, you're probably gonna have to use the continuity of ATP given that it's contained in a semi-finite sythase of a complex contour
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:07am MST	I still have to do the one that implies prions are totally bounded on human kidneys given they they are uniformly integrable
Jose Celaya	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:06am MST	Ok cool. Haha, we proved totally bounded sets are bounded, it all sounds made up
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:05am MST	Lol this sounds made up
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:05am MST	The one about why the Taylor polynomials we talked about aren't generalizations of one dimension Taylor polynomials
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:04am MST	Daniel, where/when do you wanna go for your birthday dinner???
Jose Celaya	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:04am MST	Well, I've got like half of the Taylor one
Jose Celaya	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:03am MST	Which one? I've done everything except the semi definite one and the Taylor polynomial
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:03am MST	I have one more to do after class
Jose Celaya	Friday, February 24, 2017 at 8:02am MST	Hey Emanuel you finish the analysis HW?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 10:33pm MST	That's what it's for.

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 10:19pm MST	Dude I cant afford to bet. The test is like 100 bucks lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 10:18pm MST	We should bet
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 10:18pm MST	I want to know what percent black I am
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 10:17pm MST	üçâ
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 10:16pm MST	üçâ

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 10:15pm MST	Guys

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 10:02pm MST	Ok. Remind me tomorrow haha
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 10:01pm MST	Doesn't have to be too specific
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 10:01pm MST	Yeah pretty much
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 10:01pm MST	Like what I specifically do day to day? Or what?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 10:00pm MST	Nah it's fine. I have a pretty good idea. What would be helpful though, is if you have some time before tomorrow at 3, just send me a few sentences about your role in the research since I shadowed you
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 9:59pm MST	Yup, good luck! If you want I can look at that middle machine and tell you what it is tomorrow when I go in around 9am, I just have literally never used it so ive never noticed it before lol
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 9:58pm MST	Awesome. That's all I need, thank you!
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 9:54pm MST	In the third pic, the far left is another rocker, idk what the middle one is, and the one on the right I think is called a spinner, but we call it a wheel of fortune.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 9:53pm MST	The second one is an incubator, with a shaker, maybe a shaking incubator? Haha idk if it has a special name.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 9:52pm MST	The first one is a rocker.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 9:44pm MST	And those

Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 5:14pm MST	Olivia can you email me your presentation? I won't use it all, I just need some parts of it
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 12:29pm MST	Well one application went to 8 school so it's not that much
Jose Celaya	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 12:20pm MST	I did 12 and I thought I was crazy
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 12:20pm MST	17

Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 12:18pm MST	If I don't, I'll be taking the Emanuel route
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 12:17pm MST	I mean I applied to shitty schools too so I'm sure at least I'll get an offer from them
Jose Celaya	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 12:16pm MST	Well all your apps were due in February, don't stress til March
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 12:16pm MST	I'm begining to stress a bit
Jose Celaya	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 12:15pm MST	Same...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 12:15pm MST	I haven't gotten anything either ...
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 11:54am MST	You really need to stop trying to make sweet love to me. It's making me uncomfortable.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, February 23, 2017 at 11:16am MST	Dont worry emanuel, you can be my plus 1

Daniel Osorio	Wednesday, February 22, 2017 at 12:29pm MST	I just got the offer
Daniel Osorio	Wednesday, February 22, 2017 at 8:55am MST	I know right
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, February 22, 2017 at 8:49am MST	Its a good thing you still submitted an incomplete application.
Daniel Osorio	Wednesday, February 22, 2017 at 8:49am MST	I know, that was going to be my safe choice
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, February 22, 2017 at 8:47am MST	Haha do it! Might as well
Daniel Osorio	Wednesday, February 22, 2017 at 8:47am MST	unofficial
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, February 22, 2017 at 8:46am MST	Yeah, I dont get the impression that its very competitive there. Official or unofficial transcripts?
Daniel Osorio	Wednesday, February 22, 2017 at 8:46am MST	Yeah, I'll send it right now
Daniel Osorio	Wednesday, February 22, 2017 at 8:45am MST	Maybe they didn't receive as many applications
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, February 22, 2017 at 8:44am MST	Lol what really? Send them a transcript then
Daniel Osorio	Wednesday, February 22, 2017 at 8:44am MST	I submitted the application incomplete and just got an email that if I send my transcript I will likely get a position
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, February 22, 2017 at 8:43am MST	Um yeah I think so, because you needed another letter right
Daniel Osorio	Wednesday, February 22, 2017 at 8:43am MST	Remember that I told you I wasn't going to apply to Iowa?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, February 22, 2017 at 8:42am MST	From who
Daniel Osorio	Wednesday, February 22, 2017 at 8:42am MST	I got a weird email
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, February 22, 2017 at 8:42am MST	Thanks!

Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:40pm MST	thanks
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:40pm MST	okay, I'll see if I can find something
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:36pm MST	I think so. Maybe under finances or something?
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:35pm MST	can you get it from uaccess?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:35pm MST	I think its called a 1038
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:34pm MST	Its the one you get from the u of a summarizing your tuition, grants, loans etc
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:34pm MST	I think at least lol.
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:34pm MST	what's a 1038?
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:34pm MST	makes sense
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:33pm MST	Im pretty sure my marc money is on my 1038, because its considered a stipend, which is similar to a grant I think
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:32pm MST	I dont think it had marc money on it, probably just whatever work study you had during the spring before marc started.
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:32pm MST	really? I got one by mail like a month ago, but I didn't really checked it
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:31pm MST	I dont think we get a w2 for marc. I never got one.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:30pm MST	I was thinking 1038
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:30pm MST	You mean w2
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:30pm MST	Ohhhh wait
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:30pm MST	It should just be by year I thought...idk though
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:29pm MST	I tried, but it only shows the one for when I was in work study before MARC
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:17pm MST	I think you can download it on uaccess?
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 8:12pm MST	guys, do you know who I should email if I need another W2 because I lost the one I got from the mail?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 11:50am MST	Otherwise I wont know where to come find you lol
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 11:50am MST	4th, but you have to take that exact elevator
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 11:50am MST	What floor are you on Olivia ?

Daniel Osorio	Sunday, February 19, 2017 at 8:19pm MST	I think there's a program or software or whatever it's called that tricks the page into thinking that you're using the school wifi

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, February 16, 2017 at 9:49pm MST	My auto correct didn't want me to type blood
Jose Celaya	Thursday, February 16, 2017 at 9:49pm MST	The ratio of normal talk to butthole talk is at an all time low
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, February 16, 2017 at 9:48pm MST	In which case locking doesn't sound like a bad idea
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, February 16, 2017 at 9:48pm MST	Unless you're in prison

Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, February 16, 2017 at 9:46pm MST	I don't think that's good
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, February 16, 2017 at 9:46pm MST	One day I just realized I shit out a little bit of blood. It didn't even hurt
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, February 16, 2017 at 9:45pm MST	I dunno but the bleeding is decreasing

Jose Celaya	Thursday, February 16, 2017 at 9:41pm MST	I know, a healthy ratio is like 50
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, February 16, 2017 at 9:41pm MST	The ratio of stupid shit to HW talk has gone terribly bad in this chat
Jose Celaya	Thursday, February 16, 2017 at 9:40pm MST	Kinda disappointed, but I need a late day

Jose Celaya	Thursday, February 16, 2017 at 9:23pm MST	I mean, is vary n and graph each one, there's probably a pattern

Jose Celaya	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 7:55pm MST	I guess I could go sober at like 11
Jose Celaya	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 7:54pm MST	You guys are barely going to the casino, and I really can't be out past 1, and if I wanted to drink I'd need like a couple hours to be good to drive. So we'd have to go to the club at like 10 at the latest.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, February 3, 2017 at 7:53pm MST	I thought we were still going

Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 8:50pm MST	Haha, that's awesome

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 8:50pm MST	I remember there were so many new fonts we had never seen before.

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:26pm MST	How could you lose such a treasure
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:25pm MST	She also got me an elephant one where my dick is the trunk but I lost it.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:23pm MST	A girl I dated got it for me
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:16pm MST	Lmfao ok I forgive you for taking a nap
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:16pm MST	Why do you have a thong?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:16pm MST	Oh my gosh
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:15pm MST	That's all you get to see for free

Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:13pm MST	Guys I hadn't done laundry in so long that I had to wear my thong
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:10pm MST	Ok ill accept that answer
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:09pm MST	But the dream was from last night
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:09pm MST	I did nap today
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:08pm MST	Yeah fucking right
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:07pm MST	Last night
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 6:51pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 6:51pm MST	Emanuel, that question is a trap
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 6:51pm MST	Was this last night? Or do you mean to tell me you got to take a nap
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 6:27pm MST	This must be a sign.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 6:21pm MST	I had a dream that the new guy got added to the chat and he sent a message that just said &quot;juice&quot; and then sent a close up picture of his eye.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 11:24am MST	This family is falling apart
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 10:00am MST	Beginning*
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:59am MST	And no, were not being racist, it's a simple phonetic matter. James , Joey , and Jake are all phonetically identical in the begining. They don't sound like Juan, Julio , or Jose
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:58am MST	Yeah fuck Jaime
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:57am MST	He'll never read these
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:57am MST	Juan doesn't care what name we call him
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:57am MST	Jake, Joey, james, John those are the white ass names
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:57am MST	But we're not doing it cause he's white
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:57am MST	Yes
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:57am MST	So y'all are allowed to do it because youre brown?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:57am MST	It's cause he's new
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:56am MST	We're not saying the different names cause he's white
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:56am MST	But that would be racist
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:56am MST	Wow. You know if you were a bunch of white guys being dicks to the one new brown guy in the group, calling him different J names like juan, Jos√©, julio, etc that would be pretty shitty
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:54am MST	The point is, we don't want Joey here
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:54am MST	His name is Jake
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:52am MST	James, not Colbert
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:24am MST	Fuck that guy
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:34am MST	Hahaha, I know
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:33am MST	His name is fucking jake
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:33am MST	Oh, that's another reason we can't invite John, he probably doesn't even believe in 2 chainz
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:32am MST	And pray to 2-chainz every day
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:32am MST	Just listen to the motivational penguin
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 7:31am MST	Except with science.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 10:31pm MST	Holy shit you guys this semester is literally killing me. Fuck.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 9:23pm MST	Follow your heart
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 9:16pm MST	This might take me a few days to think about
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 9:03pm MST	&quot;estate quieto&quot; is what Mexican ladies say when they feel like that.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 9:03pm MST	Hmmmmm im gonna think about this.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 9:03pm MST	Like hes always tapping his foot or twirling his pencil or making some sort of noise
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 9:02pm MST	Shit I gotta think about that. I mean Scott is always fidgeting with shit, which drives me up the fucking wall but thats not like a specific guy thing.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 9:01pm MST	The stage is yours
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 9:01pm MST	Any of them you want to tell us.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 9:00pm MST	Oh shit idk. Like just regular guys or boyfriends or Scott or what?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 8:36pm MST	Olivia, what's the most annoying thing that guys do?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:40pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	No wonder girls are always mad at guys
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:37pm MST	It's really not
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:37pm MST	Paul, I have also felt like a sex toy lately. It's not dope
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:36pm MST	You know how if you eat a really big meal and it makes you really happy and sleepy and not care about responsibilities? Sex is the same way
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:35pm MST	Lol sex does make you unproductive.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:26pm MST	Orgasms are temporary. Satisfaction is forever
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:24pm MST	Sex makes you very unproductive
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:24pm MST	Olivia how could you be too busy for sex? You just have to walk down the hall
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:23pm MST	Olivia gets it
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:16pm MST	Amen paul. Being too busy for sex is the worst.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:14pm MST	*poor bastard
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:12pm MST	You lucky motherfucker
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:11pm MST	I never said too many, just too much. Sex takes up a lot of time
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:10pm MST	That's not harsh, I think you're in a good place in your life if your problem is that too many girls want to have sex with you
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:09pm MST	Harsh
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:09pm MST	Ready and willing girls are wasted on you Paul
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:08pm MST	Im tired and I have stuff to do, was I not clear in the text to her? Haha
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:04pm MST	How could you turn that down?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 7:04pm MST	Why tho

Jose Celaya	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 6:58pm MST	Paul I hate you
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 6:57pm MST	Why?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 6:56pm MST	Jose you will hate me
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:37pm MST	Paul needs time to heal
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:36pm MST	I day invite him. Worst case scenario, he's a douche and no one talks to him so he stops looking at the chat
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:35pm MST	He doesn't look cool at all there
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	Here's him being smart
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:33pm MST	It just looks like some dude climbing a rock. It looks like an ad in a magazine
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:32pm MST	I don't have a strong opinion about this.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:21pm MST	Pic for pic
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:20pm MST	I need a picture

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:19pm MST	He literally said hi im jake and thats it
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:18pm MST	Is he a douche though?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:17pm MST	Yeah but I dont wanna have 2 group chats..its too much responsibility
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:16pm MST	That's true. This group chat has become about more than just MARC
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:15pm MST	Group chat is sacred
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:15pm MST	He refuses to let us invite him to a group chat
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:15pm MST	It sounds like Paul doesn't see any reason to open his heart
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:14pm MST	And I hate his hair
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:14pm MST	This guy rock climbs for fun. What a douche

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:13pm MST	Paul doesn't have to open his heart if he doesn't want to
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:10pm MST	Fuck that guy
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:10pm MST	Hes so sad now. You have to convince him to open his heart
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:09pm MST	Emanuel Paul hates the new guy because he misses you so much

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, January 29, 2017 at 5:57pm MST	And i feel like im way more committed to this conversation than you are, based on our relative levels of excitement at the prospect of you getting laid.

Jose Celaya	Sunday, January 29, 2017 at 7:48am MST	Hey Emanuel, I thought we said 10 for the meeting with Wuri
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 8:17pm MST	I'm definitely not telling you now
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 8:16pm MST	No fuck you and your deception. How dare you

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 8:11pm MST	What's your middle name
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 8:11pm MST	Is your mind blown?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 8:11pm MST	Our friendship just went to a whole other level
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 8:10pm MST	I was cleaning out my emails, and I saw it
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 8:06pm MST	Lol yeah why

Daniel Osorio	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 1:42pm MST	0.153 g was the starting amount
Daniel Osorio	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 1:41pm MST	yes
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 1:41pm MST	Thats ok. Do you have your starting amount of borneol, final amount of camphor, and your mp?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 1:41pm MST	Just got the IR, thanks daniel!
Daniel Osorio	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 1:40pm MST	Olivia, I sent the IR to your email, it looks a little weird because of the scanning
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:58am MST	3rd
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:58am MST	What floor are you on
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:42am MST	Sounds good
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:42am MST	Jose I'm gonna pick up breakfast at the union and then go over
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:38am MST	Haha, that's awesome. Where can we get these socks
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:36am MST	Science engineering. I'm always down for lit shit
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:35am MST	Oh shit. This homework party is gonna be lit.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:35am MST	Where are you Jose?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:34am MST	Idk how long that shit will take
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:34am MST	I have to go to my lab today
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:34am MST	Down. I just got here
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:33am MST	Let's have a homework party
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:30am MST	Yup. People do that shit in wartime.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:29am MST	You'd have to. You'd give in to your hunger. It's like 1984
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:29am MST	Yeah but in book of eli the cannibals had these really bad tremors. Thats how you knew how to stay away from them
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:28am MST	I'd eat people.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:27am MST	They had a big cannibal problem
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:24am MST	I don't see the connection
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:24am MST	Yeah
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:24am MST	And mila kunis and Gary oldman
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:24am MST	Where he translated the Bible or some shit?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:23am MST	Its a movie with denzel washington lol
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:23am MST	Denzel Washington movie
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:23am MST	I don't know what the book of Eli is
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:23am MST	Then a subset of the girls could feed everyone
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:23am MST	Just knock up countably infinitely many girls
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:21am MST	I'd have to find some other source of food though. The more girls I'd knock up for milk, the more babies I'd have to feed
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:21am MST	I think thats basically the blot of the book of eli
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:20am MST	You can have your cottage cheese Emanuel
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:20am MST	Now thats some fucking logic.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:20am MST	Well I guess that's logical
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:20am MST	Yes.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:20am MST	So we're saying in a world where humans can only eat humans, it's ok too eat humans because they themselves have eaten human?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:19am MST	The lions?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:19am MST	Wait what emanuel who ate human?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:19am MST	I don't know what's going on anymore
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:19am MST	But there aren't enough out there to feed everyone
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:19am MST	If they're alive they've eaten human, which according to you is super fucked up
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:19am MST	Sure
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:19am MST	Or a child molester?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:18am MST	Yeah, would you kill a murderer and eat them?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:18am MST	As Emanuel would say, we're getting too meta
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:18am MST	Oh my gosh
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:18am MST	How innocent are humans?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:18am MST	Lol how does it not make sense?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:18am MST	Lol what's stopping you from doing that right now emanuel?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:18am MST	*would eat a
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:17am MST	I'm just saying lion kin don't make no sense
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:17am MST	I would was a dead human, but I'd rather die than kill an innocent human for food
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:17am MST	I'd start knocking girls up and making cottage cheese
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:17am MST	Cows produce a shit load of milk compared to what a person could produce
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:17am MST	Sure, it would just be super inefficient.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:16am MST	Its not like lions can go to the super market and buy tofu instead of gazelles.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:16am MST	Like from breast milk
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:16am MST	Could you make dairy products from people?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:16am MST	He just said thats the only thing I could eat are people
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:15am MST	No dairy?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:14am MST	If thats all I could eat, then thats what I would have to eat.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:14am MST	I would eat humans.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:13am MST	What would you do if all you could eat were humans?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:12am MST	Maybe Jose could convince the lions to become vegetarians
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:12am MST	And besides, what were the lions supposed to eat if were assuming that all animals in the hypothetical lion king world spoke
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:11am MST	You cant just assume the gazelles and shit spoke, you never saw them speak.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:10am MST	If Ramon and pumba could speak
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:10am MST	Yup
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:10am MST	And the gazelles and stuff could speak
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:10am MST	Dammit
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:10am MST	It's Sunday?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:08am MST	Sunday
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:02am MST	What did the lions eat that spoke?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:01am MST	I don't eat anything that speaks
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:50am MST	I dont get it. So do you?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:49am MST	Lol what??
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:49am MST	I don't like the lion king, the lions are sentient beings that eat other sentient beings
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:46am MST	Dammit jose havent you ever seen the lion king?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:45am MST	Haha, unfortunately a lot, for starters I'm always late
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:44am MST	Nothing. What's a motto with you?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:42am MST	What is a motto?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:38am MST	Jos√© ask me what a motto is
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:37am MST	Lol that should be your motto
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:37am MST	I'll be late, but I'll be there
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:37am MST	Lol looks like that isn't happening if it was supposed to be at 10
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:36am MST	We have to meet our group
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:36am MST	We have to write up the solutions to this week's homework. Don't worry, we're not there by choice
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:36am MST	Damn, I didnt even get an invite to the homework party....thats cold.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:36am MST	I totally forgot
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:34am MST	Emanuel we were meeting at 10?
Daniel Osorio	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 7:33pm MST	same, everyone had to because the spots themselves have no dye and aren't visible under UV light
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 7:29pm MST	Yeah, the TA had us stain ours with this pink dye that ive never seen them use before
Daniel Osorio	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 7:28pm MST	the spots weren't really yellow but they were visible
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 7:22pm MST	Lol well did your TLC plate work?
Daniel Osorio	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 7:21pm MST	now I feel like I did something wrong
Daniel Osorio	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 7:20pm MST	I finished kind of early
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 7:17pm MST	Awesome thank you so much!! That lab was so stupid, like half our class didnt finish
Daniel Osorio	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 7:16pm MST	yeah
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 7:14pm MST	Yeah thats totally fine. Could you scan your IR for me too???
Daniel Osorio	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 7:13pm MST	Olivia, is it okay if I send you my results tomorrow morning? I don't have my notebook with me right now
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:33pm MST	I think I invited you guys to the group
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:33pm MST	Hey do you guys know that march for science thats happening in march
Jose Celaya	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:23pm MST	I bet captain america could sell the shit out of crack
Jose Celaya	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:22pm MST	Fuck
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:22pm MST	Holy shit. I have an American flag shirt
Jose Celaya	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:22pm MST	#amazonchangeslives
Jose Celaya	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:21pm MST	First the glasses make you smart, now the putty makes you strong. All you need is a shield and you can be fuckin captain America.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:21pm MST	You're
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:21pm MST	It's OK. Your gonna be a doctor
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:20pm MST	I'm gonna have strong ass hands
Jose Celaya	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:20pm MST	Is that a good thing?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:20pm MST	Youre life is bullshit and im so jealous.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:20pm MST	It's firm AF
Jose Celaya	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:20pm MST	Is it all you dreamed of?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:20pm MST	Goddammit emanuel
Jose Celaya	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:20pm MST	How is it?
Jose Celaya	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:20pm MST	Haha
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:19pm MST	The putty I ordered on Amazon
Jose Celaya	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:19pm MST	What's here?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:19pm MST	Jose it's here
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:14pm MST	Daniel I didnt get to finish my experiment today. Can I use your results and your IR for my report pretty please???
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 11:39am MST	I think I'm going with Jose on the phone issue
Jose Celaya	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 11:27am MST	Haha great idea. Everyone should do that. Then we can watch him tweet his anger.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 11:26am MST	We should just keep calling him president elect even though he's the president
Jose Celaya	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 11:24am MST	People should write code for autocorrect that just changes it to &quot;Nope&quot;
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 11:23am MST	You shouldn't be able to write those words
Jose Celaya	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 11:22am MST	Did you throw up a little bit?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 11:22am MST	For the first time, I'm seeing the words &quot;President Trump&quot; on the news.
Jose Celaya	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 11:09am MST	I'd keep it, but then again I have an IPhone.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 11:09am MST	I'd also exchange the shit out of it.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:42am MST	See Im the same, i loved my HTC but I've had it over 3 years...
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:39am MST	I know but i love my note 5...ive been using it for like over a year now
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:38am MST	I lost faith in the note lol but I definitely need a new phone now because the screen on my other one stopped working
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:37am MST	Scott had an edge, neither of us cared for it, but just because of the edge. The regular s7 is good. Im holding out for the note 8
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:36am MST	Yeah.. my choices were this or the galaxy S7 edge and I just wanted to try this one because everyone has the galaxy
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:34am MST	That*
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:34am MST	I would never support a system that intentionally removed the universal usb or the headphones jack, simple as thay
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:32am MST	The android system itself is the best I've ever used , but I really hate the different USB. I would basically have to carry my charger or an adaptor with me everywhere because no one else has type C
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:29am MST	I would exchange the shit out of it, if it were me
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:24am MST	I bought the Moto Z droid from Verizon ,but I just now realized that this is the iPhone of androids. It has no headphone jack so it needs a converter and the charger uses a USB type c instead of micro USB like all other androids. The pros is that it's really fast, great camera , and it has a fingerprint scanner. Also I can buy mods for it to make it into a projector or a phone with 22 hr extra battery life. Should I keep it or exchange it ?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:20am MST	Que onda
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:20am MST	Guys I need your opinion
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:30am MST	I guess thats a no...
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 8:08pm MST	Dont you love us emanuel
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 8:07pm MST	What about the actual colloquium
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 8:04pm MST	I'll channel good vibes remotely
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 7:58pm MST	üò¢
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 7:58pm MST	You figured me out.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 7:55pm MST	I knew it. You hate us.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 7:53pm MST	I can't. I have class from 1-4:40
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 7:38pm MST	Wednesday at 230 somewhere at umc
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 7:37pm MST	When and where?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 7:28pm MST	Well yeah that too. Daniel and I are going to practice on wednesday though
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 7:27pm MST	During the seminar?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 7:25pm MST	Emanuel you can come listen to our presentations
Jose Celaya	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 7:22pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 7:22pm MST	Sounds good
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 7:16pm MST	Jose let's meet after class so we can talk about who's gonna do what for the solutions
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 6:02pm MST	sure
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 6:01pm MST	Ok. Im writing my procedure now. Ill let you know if I need help with the prelab
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 6:00pm MST	did*
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 6:00pm MST	but no one fid the sublimation since I think is optional
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 6:00pm MST	Oh ok good. I have to go to my lab for like 3 hours after I get out, so thats gonna suck...
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 5:59pm MST	an*

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 1:09pm MST	Paul: if they have a section, or if they have a work experience section you can include it there, or &quot;significant life events&quot;. You can fit it in even if they dont specifically ask for volunteer stuff, but if they dont ask any of those other types of things they probably dont give a shit.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 1:08pm MST	Jose: start with your first experiment first since its done. If you cant fill up 20 minutes, talk about your new project, why youre doing it, what you hope to accomplish
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 1:08pm MST	üçâ
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 1:00pm MST	Like as a volunteer service that I've done

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 24, 2017 at 8:17pm MST	Only after a while he started saying it wrong and started saying &quot;que pene&quot; and everyone would just smile at him and nobody told him for like a month
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 24, 2017 at 8:16pm MST	And he told us this story of when he first started speaking Spanish, he learned this saying &quot;que pena&quot; like what a pity
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 24, 2017 at 8:15pm MST	Yeah my high school Spanish teacher was white, and he wore sandals, shorts, and Hawaiian tshirts. He only knew Spanish because he lived in chile for 9 months
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 24, 2017 at 8:15pm MST	Instead of saying si, he'd say thi
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 24, 2017 at 8:14pm MST	The teacher was Spanish so his s sounds were all lispy
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 24, 2017 at 8:14pm MST	That's true. It was a class only people who were native speakers.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 24, 2017 at 8:13pm MST	Yeah but that was like a real upper division Spanish class, not freshman year of High school Spanish taught by the driver's ed teacher
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 24, 2017 at 8:11pm MST	In my Spanish class we could only communicate in Spanish
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 24, 2017 at 8:10pm MST	We also had english Spanish dictionaries for Spanish class.

Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 24, 2017 at 7:47pm MST	Did you ever use a non online thesaurus?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 24, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	Like I didnt know what to type I felt so stupid. I just had to share that in case yall are miserable doing personal statements.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 24, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	Lol so I forgot the word &quot;thesaurus&quot; momentarily and I couldn't figure out how to look up the word on google.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 24, 2017 at 2:56pm MST	Yeah I thought I could do it to anywhere that accepts electronic transcripts
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, January 24, 2017 at 2:50pm MST	I think the UA only sends electronic transcripts to pre-approved organizations

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:46pm MST	You like how I been using af instead of spelling it out?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:46pm MST	I think she was thinking about the money
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:46pm MST	Lol she sounds dumb af
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:46pm MST	I literally told her that I don't see why I should maximize my access to research careers if I don't want one
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:45pm MST	Why would she think thats an option???
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:45pm MST	I think that's good though.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:45pm MST	Its maximizing access to RESEARCH careers
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:45pm MST	Dr. Tsichler said no
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:44pm MST	Wait maybe you can stay in marc but not do research?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:44pm MST	Oh snaps.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:44pm MST	I told MARC that I was leaving first and then her. And then she said that maybe you can stay in MARC even if you don't want to do research. I brought up that she said that with Dr. Tsichler and he said he emailed her
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:43pm MST	I mean why do you think that
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:43pm MST	Why
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:42pm MST	I think Dr. Tischler sent her a nasty email
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:42pm MST	Thats good at least. Fuck it.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:41pm MST	Yeah
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:41pm MST	After you get your grade does the I go away on your transcript?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:41pm MST	Agreed. Fuck it.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:41pm MST	They were gonna re print it for me but it wasn't gonna be ready for another 3 hours so I just took the matte and got my money back...
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:41pm MST	I barely changed my poster. I'm pretty sure she's gonna give me a bad grade, but fuck it
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:40pm MST	I finally got my poster printed but they accidentally printed matte even though I paid for glossy
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:40pm MST	Lol she sounds fucking crazy.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:39pm MST	To present. I guess she wants to make sure I'm there.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:39pm MST	What? For you to do the poster session? Or for her to be there?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:38pm MST	Yeah. It's part of the incomplete contract.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:38pm MST	I mean mine is too, but to be supportive and shit
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:38pm MST	Lol what is your pi coming to see your poster?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:37pm MST	3:15-4:30 no rounds
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:33pm MST	When are you going to fight your pi?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:33pm MST	Fuck yeah
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:32pm MST	We should probably just make it a pay per view while we're at it
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:31pm MST	So I'm not stuck with all the responsibility you know
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:31pm MST	Maybe someone else could yell while I record, and somebody else could sell tickets or something
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:31pm MST	That feels very involved.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:30pm MST	You have to yell &quot;WORLDSTAR&quot; while you're recording it though.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:29pm MST	I will definitely post that shit for you.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:29pm MST	Probably both

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 20, 2017 at 4:23pm MST	Guys, if I fight my PI or postdoc will you promise to put it on worldstar?

Jose Celaya	Thursday, January 19, 2017 at 12:15pm MST	You can only have one
Jose Celaya	Thursday, January 19, 2017 at 12:15pm MST	It's either a hobo beard or a research career
Jose Celaya	Thursday, January 19, 2017 at 12:15pm MST	But that's against lab safety protocols
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, January 19, 2017 at 12:14pm MST	No I would have a hobo beard

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, January 19, 2017 at 11:02am MST	I can serve as the control. If I don't get gray hairs, it's cause the research. If I do it's cause we're just fucked

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, January 19, 2017 at 10:55am MST	Its the third one ive ever had in my life...
Jose Celaya	Thursday, January 19, 2017 at 10:53am MST	You're not a real researcher until you pull out a grey hair
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, January 19, 2017 at 10:53am MST	Jesus christ you guys its only the 2nd week of school and I pulled out a grey hair this morning.

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, January 18, 2017 at 5:35pm MST	He can get out and get his own job and support his own bullshit
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, January 18, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	He's gonna rebel
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, January 18, 2017 at 5:29pm MST	I am not raising that kind of trash in my home.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, January 18, 2017 at 5:23pm MST	Maybe he's a fuck boy. You should support him
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, January 18, 2017 at 5:21pm MST	God. I had to take the sweater off, I kept looking at him and thinking of those fuck boys
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, January 18, 2017 at 5:20pm MST	We should enroll him in Eller
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, January 18, 2017 at 5:14pm MST	He looks like such a little frat boy douche but it was the only one I could find that I kinda liked for him
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, January 18, 2017 at 5:13pm MST	The dark sweater would go well with some dress socks.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, January 18, 2017 at 4:50pm MST	Some dogs but mine wont because of their floppy ears, they just shake their heads til the hat comes off
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, January 18, 2017 at 4:49pm MST	Can you get dogs to wear hats?

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, January 18, 2017 at 11:15am MST	üçâ

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 8:43pm MST	Holy shit I loved that one
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 8:43pm MST	Or the one where the guy visits the hospital to meet the chief
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 8:43pm MST	There is no time too late to watch it
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 8:43pm MST	Greys anatomy transcends time
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 8:42pm MST	But its getting late maybe I should just go to bed.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 8:42pm MST	Well, my worst one is where the guy gets hit by a car
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 8:42pm MST	This is like one of the worst ones though.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 8:42pm MST	Not for the faint of heart
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 8:41pm MST	Yeah, that one's pretty bad, but there are a lot of sad ones, greys anatomy is an emotional roller coaster
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 8:41pm MST	Like I almost wanna skip it. That episode wrecked me the first time I saw it.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 8:41pm MST	Holy shit
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 8:40pm MST	Where the guy gets hit by the bus....

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 5:18pm MST	Lol im not sure actually, they're always saying that shit.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 5:02pm MST	I'd ask what episode that's from but I don't want any spoilers
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 4:45pm MST	Definitely
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 4:41pm MST	We're still gonna be greys anatomy buddies right?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 4:34pm MST	The things I liked I didn't get to do enough of.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 4:31pm MST	I'm pretty sure I was on my PI's bad side, but even when I wasn't, it was meh.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 4:30pm MST	Was your lab that bad?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 4:29pm MST	That would have made me miserable
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 4:28pm MST	At least you were honest, most people would have ridden MARC for the money anyways
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 4:27pm MST	I also just didn't like what I did all day.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 4:26pm MST	It just seemed like I was doing a lot for something that probably wouldn't have that much of an effect
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 4:24pm MST	What made you realize you don't want research in your life?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 4:22pm MST	Oh ok thats good at least
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 4:22pm MST	I still have to work on mine for my grade.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 4:21pm MST	We never even got to work on our posters together..
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 4:20pm MST	I am shocked
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 4:20pm MST	He's still around, friendship transcends MARC
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 4:19pm MST	Thats it. Im never gonna learn Spanish if emanuel leaves
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, January 11, 2017 at 4:19pm MST	Yeah, I don't know why is masculine

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:22pm MST	I'd rather channel my inner Thomas Jefferson, but that's not very good for marketing myself
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:21pm MST	You need to channel your inner cristina yang. You gotta know youre hot shit.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:20pm MST	Now that I'm filling out applications, I can see why everyone thinks I'm so smart
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:20pm MST	Fucking retake that shit next summer.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:20pm MST	I failed Michael Flynn
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:19pm MST	Real talk though, the worst part of being a micro major is being sick. Every horrible disease I could possibly have is running through my mind.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:18pm MST	Fuck the GRE who gives a shit. Just retake it and make that test lick your butthole.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:17pm MST	Fucking GRE. I got such a mediocre score
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:17pm MST	Mi culpa
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:16pm MST	You didn't even mention incessantly
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:15pm MST	Phoning. Harps. Look at all this GRE vocabulary
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:15pm MST	I've kinda been phoning it in since it was a good job to have, and she's the kinda person that incessantly harps on things. Now that I'm in MARC, she's been pushy
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:13pm MST	Yeah thats true. It feels weird not having a letter from Dr. Wright since I spent the summer in his lab, but I also didnt really do anything so it would also be weird if he did write me a letter.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:12pm MST	Three semesters and two summers of pure pleasure
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:11pm MST	Tsichler says itd be weird if she didnt since i've been with her for a while
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:11pm MST	She seems like a bitch.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:10pm MST	Apparently
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:09pm MST	Lol shes writing letters for you??
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:08pm MST	Getting rec letters from my PI so that I can leave the lab
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:07pm MST	Lol why
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:07pm MST	Lol jesus christ
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:07pm MST	I have a newfound motivation for getting my applicaitions done
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:07pm MST	He reminds me of a pokemon when they have enough xp to evolve but they refuse.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:06pm MST	Yeah but hes been doing that shit since I first met him.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:03pm MST	I think his muscle twitches are him revving up to write rec letters
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:03pm MST	He's pretty fast
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:03pm MST	Holy shit. I submitted my first application last night, and I already got a notificaci√≥n that dr. Tischler sent my letter of recommendation.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 9:58pm MST	Ive officially submitted one application, and started on 5 others, and one I cant figure out how to open.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 9:58pm MST	I actually prefer talking to him on the phone. I can concentrate on what im trying to say instead of being distracted by his weird muscle twitches
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 9:42pm MST	How are your guys' summer applications going?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 7:55pm MST	Oh shit guys. I'm going to talk to Dr. Tischler on the phone after he's done with dinner
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 5:07pm MST	I'll answer when I get home
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 4:50pm MST	That gives me a late pass
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 4:50pm MST	I took initiative though
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 4:49pm MST	Dammit Jos√©
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 4:49pm MST	Jos√© you didnt even answer it and you made the fucking thing.

Jose Celaya	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 4:41pm MST	Ok, yep that's what I heard last. Thanks
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 4:41pm MST	The problem is getting money from multiple grants, so I think it's fine as long as we don't get paid.
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 4:24pm MST	Emanuel
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 4:24pm MST	I thought I saw one m

Jose Celaya	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 4:18pm MST	Just got an email from Corrie for availability this semester, she was supposed to talk to Cindy.
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 4:18pm MST	Hey Emmanuel, are we still able to be tutors?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 2:05pm MST	I put all my available times, but monday is best if yall can make that work again

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 1:48pm MST	Yeah Cindy will have to take care of you guys.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 1:48pm MST	Cindy then
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 1:48pm MST	That's true. You're basically dying.

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 11:00pm MST	Ok like he got shot at the end of the episode? And then you stopped watching?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:59pm MST	Yesterday.

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:55pm MST	Like I was when I saw that episode.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:55pm MST	I dont know if that's Spanish that's just what people say when they talk about something and they are at a loss for words.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:54pm MST	I don't follow

Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:49pm MST	I'm not even that dumb, and I'm an idiot.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:48pm MST	Cause they were dumb as fuck. People are fucking stupid all the time.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:48pm MST	If you were shooting in the back yard, you'd use a dud.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:48pm MST	And why would the guys use live ammunition if they were shooting it in their backyard?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:48pm MST	Yeah. But George was a fucking badass delivering Baileys baby
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:47pm MST	I wanted someone to just do something.

Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:37pm MST	Guys my grade for my incomplete is coming from my poster revisions, and motivation to do it is shit.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:34pm MST	I agree with the second one, very much
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:34pm MST	Also, fuck summer applications.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:34pm MST	That's dumb.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:33pm MST	Dresses are but the word dresses isn't
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:33pm MST	And then there's all the irregular verbs.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:33pm MST	I feel like dresses are pretty damn feminine.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:33pm MST	I always say la mapa
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:33pm MST	Yeah but why isn't it a vestida
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:32pm MST	That I don't know
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:32pm MST	Why is it el mapa and not la mapa?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:32pm MST	It ends in o
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:32pm MST	Why is vestido masculine if its a üëó
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:32pm MST	I finally finished my first batch of essay questions for my summer applications and sent them to dr. Tischler....
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:31pm MST	Colonialism wrecks everything
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:31pm MST	You can count exceptions on one hand
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:31pm MST	Well...the rules are never broken
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:31pm MST	See. Spanish is confusing.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:30pm MST	Apparently it's arabic. It means melon from Sind (a place in India)
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:22pm MST	Lol cause that's silly
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 3, 2017 at 10:21pm MST	¬øPor qu√© no mel√≥n de agua?

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:28pm MST	¬øPor qu√©?
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:27pm MST	When you ask us what's up from now on, you should say, &quot;Qu√© onda g√ºey?&quot;
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:26pm MST	I think I've heard both, but I say de nada
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:26pm MST	Do you guys say de nada or por nada?

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:24pm MST	I kind of remember how to conjugate i just never really learned past or future tense.
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:23pm MST	We have faith in you, you'll be bilingual
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:23pm MST	Tenemos fe en ti, lograr√°s ser biling√ºe
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:21pm MST	Espa√±ol es muy dif√≠cil
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:17pm MST	Spanish is much more emotional
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:16pm MST	I really like that my phone is suggesting way more emoticons
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:16pm MST	Some people are named that

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:14pm MST	I knew that one! Because in Harry Potter the pensieve is full of thoughts.
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:14pm MST	Sorry wasn't that clear haha

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:13pm MST	Facebook is asking ¬øQue estas pensando?
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:13pm MST	Soon you'll be ready for the trip to Mexico
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:13pm MST	You should write random stuff and just ask us to translate it
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:12pm MST	See im gonna learn Spanish like this
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:11pm MST	It usually loops back
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:11pm MST	Maybe write two words and then press it

Jose Celaya	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:06pm MST	So Emanuel, did you settle on an optometrist?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:05pm MST	I think I like that better
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:05pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:05pm MST	Exactly

Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 7:13pm MST	Happy New Year.. I'm late but I'm also in Mexico sooo Yeah haha
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, January 1, 2017 at 5:05pm MST	Good point
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, January 1, 2017 at 4:56pm MST	I don't think optometrists have a sense of humor
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, January 1, 2017 at 4:06pm MST	Is he funny?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, January 1, 2017 at 3:29pm MST	I don't remember his name but I think he's the only optometrist there
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, January 1, 2017 at 3:29pm MST	He's just fast and good, and I don't remember the appointments being very expensive. Like I think I went there when I was a teenager because it was covered by my insurance and then I stopped having insurance but I kept going to him because I liked him
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, January 1, 2017 at 3:26pm MST	What do you like about the optometrist?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, January 1, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	I get my eye exams at this place at speedway and swan because I really like the optometrist there, but then I take my prescription and get my frames and lenses at lesco
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, January 1, 2017 at 3:04pm MST	Where do you guys go for your glasses, eye exams, and shit?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, January 1, 2017 at 12:09am MST	That's so true!!! I just want to go to sleep. I woke up at 3am tucson time to catch our flight
Jose Celaya	Sunday, January 1, 2017 at 12:07am MST	Well...your dogs are in 2017
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, January 1, 2017 at 12:05am MST	Noooo...I'm in california I still have to wait a whole hour...
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 7:17pm MST	Ketchup makes me want to kill myself
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 6:26pm MST	But Scott's step-dad did put barbecue sauce on his pigs in a blanket, so.....
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 6:26pm MST	Not unless you put ketchup on the macaroni and hot dogs.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 5:57pm MST	Are pigs in a blanket whiter than macaroni and hot dogs?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:53pm MST	Omfg lol I don't think that'll work.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:52pm MST	Just put salsa on them and pretend they're little burritos
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:52pm MST	But I'm in northern california so I don't think I have a lot of Mexican restaurants to choose from, and Scott's mom is making pigs in a blanket, which might be the whitest food ever.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:50pm MST	Great now I want Mexican food
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:48pm MST	It's best to jump right into the deep end
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:48pm MST	I feel like I could learn a lot there first
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:47pm MST	Maybe we should start in South tucson first or like a food city.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:47pm MST	That way it's educational
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:47pm MST	I 100% support this educational experience
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:46pm MST	Yeah but we have to make sure we're with Mexican people and not just white people in rocky point
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:45pm MST	You mean like you guys drive me down to rocky point and we all get drunk?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:43pm MST	We need MARC to sponsor a cultural immersion trip to Mexico
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:43pm MST	It's hard describing stuff in Spanish without knowing how to spell things.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:43pm MST	Might have an h in front
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:42pm MST	It sounds like aye-ya-yii but not like that celito Lindo song.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:42pm MST	Ijole
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:41pm MST	Except no where near as white as saying jeez
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:41pm MST	But with more feeling
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:41pm MST	It's kind like saying jeez
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:41pm MST	How do you spell it.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:41pm MST	Don't worry
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:41pm MST	It's not
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:41pm MST	I think it might be a bad word
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:41pm MST	I don't know how to translate that one
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:41pm MST	He says it when he spills something or when the little kids are being obnoxious
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:41pm MST	Haha
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:40pm MST	There's this word my Tata says sometimes but I don't know how to spell it. It sounds like &quot;ee-hwa-le&quot; what does it mean
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:38pm MST	I have faith in you
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:38pm MST	Tengo fe en ti
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:37pm MST	It's &quot;oh-gar&quot;
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:37pm MST	Do you say the h? In hogar?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:37pm MST	Jajaja
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:36pm MST	Ok thanks. Scott's family thinks I'm real brown. Trying to fill some big ass zapatos.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:35pm MST	I meant casa
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:35pm MST	Agh
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:35pm MST	Una class no es un hogar
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:35pm MST	?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:35pm MST	Como se dice &quot;A House is Not a Home&quot; en Espa√±ol.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, December 30, 2016 at 9:03pm MST	Fuck yeah the boots were on sale.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, December 30, 2016 at 8:42pm MST	I'm thinking maybe both...
Jose Celaya	Friday, December 30, 2016 at 8:42pm MST	Shoes are cooler, but the boots keep you warm. I vote boots.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, December 30, 2016 at 8:41pm MST	???
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, December 30, 2016 at 8:40pm MST	Help guys which ones should I get
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 25, 2016 at 6:32pm MST	I'm very confused.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:53pm MST	Yeah. He didn't give me that much feedback. It was sort of like the feedback for my paper.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:50pm MST	Did Dr tischler approve it? Or are you going to send them all at once?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:49pm MST	I did a short one. It was like 200 words.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:44pm MST	Have you done any of your personal statement type questions for your applications? I haven't done any yet...
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:43pm MST	I'll cite you guys in my personal statement.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:37pm MST	Yeah, I feel like we inspired you.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:36pm MST	I've really been embracing the persona since you guys brought it up.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:30pm MST	Yeah, but it's not as cool cause it's not a wildcard move.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:30pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:25pm MST	Well it probably works for dance majors right?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:24pm MST	That would be so fucking gangster if I got into grad school and that way.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:16pm MST	I feel like that's a really good representation of you.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:15pm MST	My personal statement is actually just a link to a video of me dancing.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:13pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:13pm MST	Lol I saw a meme the other day that reminded me of you
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:12pm MST	I'll take personal responsibility for your eulogy and express my grief the only way I know how: dance.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:08pm MST	You're gonna feel so bad when I actually get murdered
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:07pm MST	He can't kill you the lab anyways. It's against lab safety protocol.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:58pm MST	Thanks
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:57pm MST	It's probably a serial killer.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:56pm MST	So I just got up to shut my lab door because this shit is way too creepy. I kept looking over my shoulder cause I thought I heard footsteps.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:56pm MST	I know right.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:55pm MST	That's the most coordinated pair shrug I've ever seen.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:43pm MST	It's definitely worth the energy investment
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:39pm MST	That sounds like a lot of work...
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:39pm MST	Then just screaming will suffice
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:38pm MST	But I can't be naked.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:37pm MST	Do everything you usually do except do it naked and screaming.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:36pm MST	Like what

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 19, 2016 at 1:35pm MST	Or just ones that are &quot;relevant&quot;???
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 19, 2016 at 1:35pm MST	Do they really want me to just type every class I've ever taken?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 19, 2016 at 1:21pm MST	Oh I haven't encountered any of that bullshit yet.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 19, 2016 at 1:18pm MST	I hate the applications that don't let you save your progress
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 19, 2016 at 1:11pm MST	Well I'm working on them. I'm gonna try to finish the basic parts of them, then later this week I'm going to work on the essay portions

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 19, 2016 at 12:02pm MST	That sounds reasonable.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 19, 2016 at 12:00pm MST	But I didn't want to put my academic advisor because I hardly ever talk to her. I think I'm just gonna put tischler.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 19, 2016 at 12:00pm MST	It's under educational information, next to my degree, gpa, major that stuff
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 19, 2016 at 11:58am MST	Where is it in the application? Cause if it's by the previous research experience, I'd put your mentor.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 19, 2016 at 11:56am MST	Summer applications
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 19, 2016 at 11:55am MST	On what?

Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 3:25pm MST	*grade
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 3:25pm MST	Her first mention of any grease was in the &quot;I'm giving you an incomplete&quot; email
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 3:24pm MST	Like my PI wrote the grading criteria with me. It was based on attendance, keeping a lab notebook, attention to detail, and writing a 200-400 word abstract. Like it was all super specific.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 3:23pm MST	She never made her grading criteria available to you?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 3:22pm MST	None of which she ever mentioned to me
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 3:21pm MST	She said I didn't do any of the things that she could grease me on
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 3:20pm MST	Dude what? Did she give you a reason?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 3:19pm MST	My stupid PI is giving me an incomplete for my lab credits
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 3:01pm MST	Ok mine is like 10 so that should be sufficient.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 3:01pm MST	13 pages
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 3:00pm MST	How long were your guys' papers when you turned them in to Dr. Tischler?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 3:00pm MST	Yeah that seems too reasonable.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 2:59pm MST	Or we could just ask them to make sure
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 12:56pm MST	Well it says you can contact her if you have different dimensions. I'm just wondering if I should make it 3 by 4 since I haven't printed mine yet...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 12:32pm MST	I'm not reprinting my poster, I'll just say I misread the email
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 11:35am MST	It says our poster is supposed to be 3 by 4, not 4 by 3
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 11:35am MST	Si

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 11:16am MST	I'm not going to the movie. I should be studying for my final
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 7:01pm MST	When do you guys wanna do dinner? Or as Jos√© insists, breakfast?

Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 11:59am MST	Most likely you though Jos√©
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 11:59am MST	Aw I was gonna say jose you should come with me to biotech!
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 11:59am MST	Any of you. Could you guys check?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 11:58am MST	Oh and Olivia, I'm at cactus, I got a table with an outlet all the way in the back next to the stairs.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 11:57am MST	Me?

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 10:00am MST	Nope I'm free then
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 10:00am MST	Sounds good
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 9:50am MST	Do you have class at one Jos√©?

Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 9:42am MST	I would also be down but my class ends at 3
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 9:41am MST	I'm quite down
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 9:37am MST	Wanna grab a bite before the show???
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 9:37am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 9:34am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 9:34am MST	Yes, yes I did
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 9:34am MST	Did you remember to bring it Jos√©?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 9:33am MST	It's ghetto wrapped but it's fucking wrapped.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 9:33am MST	Hey I wrapped mine goddammit.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 9:11am MST	Woooowwww yall are terrible Santas
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 9:10am MST	I didn't wrap it though...
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 9:08am MST	What Paul said
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 9:07am MST	He was the first one to buy it
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 8:52am MST	Jos√© did you remember to buy a secret Santa gift
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 7:06pm MST	Because he can't recall.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 7:06pm MST	But he did just ask if anyone can remember the rules for zeros in sig figs
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 7:05pm MST	I will when he starts lecturing again.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 7:05pm MST	Please
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 7:03pm MST	I feel like I should snap chat you guys my physics lecture. It's physically painful to watch
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 7:02pm MST	Fuck em
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:42pm MST	That is the best thing I have read this entire day
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:41pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:38pm MST	That's why I vote up bad reviews from her book on Amazon.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:22pm MST	I'm not even thinking about grad school apps. And I plan shit wayyyyy ahead.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:21pm MST	Lol for grad school? We don't even apply for a year.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:21pm MST	Given they are things I need to do, but I don't want to think about my rec letter for grad school during finals week
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:19pm MST	If it's just us, like 20minites
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:19pm MST	?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:19pm MST	Like 10 minutes
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:19pm MST	Not long at all
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:18pm MST	Cause I have class at 5...
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:18pm MST	Also how long is your performance?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:18pm MST	Fucking do it. Right after your ballet recital
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:18pm MST	I wanna do it myself.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:17pm MST	You want me to fight your pi?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:17pm MST	Yeah. I hate going there.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:15pm MST	Your lab sucks dick.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:15pm MST	During finals week? Fuck that
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:15pm MST	Yeah
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:15pm MST	You have to present? Like in your lab?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:14pm MST	O have to present Wednesday, but I think I'm gonna take it off anyways and let them know.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:11pm MST	Are they at least giving you next week off (
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:11pm MST	Yeah.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:11pm MST	Yeah really you should only be required to do 9 based on your credits right? You're taking 3 credits?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:10pm MST	And 14 because I've said fuck this gonna spend less times anyways
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:09pm MST	That's bullshit
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:09pm MST	They wanted me to do 16 and I've been doing about 14.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:08pm MST	Like in a given week?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:08pm MST	How much time do you spend in the lab
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:07pm MST	Talk to Cindy
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:07pm MST	Well that's kinda mean dude
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:06pm MST	Holy shit
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:06pm MST	I asked for more time off of the lab to do homework and it's turned into a series of meetings about why I'm not ready for a PhD
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:06pm MST	What do you mean?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:05pm MST	Guys my PI will not shut up about PhDs
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 5:25pm MST	Ok well I probably have some extra gift bags at home...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 4:08pm MST	Because unwrapping is the best part
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 4:07pm MST	Goddammit Paul why you gotta go and make us other Santa's look bad.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 4:07pm MST	Lol no
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 3:59pm MST	Yes, I am wrapping
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 3:59pm MST	Are y'all wrapping your present?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 3:59pm MST	Did you get a fleshlight?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 3:54pm MST	Also, I'm officially a dope ass Santa claus
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 3:17pm MST	Guys I made it
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 2:15pm MST	That's light weight
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 2:02pm MST	I'm jealous
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 1:56pm MST	I saw you jose
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 1:43pm MST	Also I really really have to pee and I can't stop burping
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 1:41pm MST	She ordered 2 pitchers of beer for 4 people
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 1:39pm MST	Thus is the worst...
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 1:39pm MST	Now I have to walk
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 1:37pm MST	Fuck and I just missed my cat bus
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 1:37pm MST	Raise your hand and answer every question
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 1:35pm MST	Oh god guys my pi got me so drunk and now I have to go to class
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:49am MST	Is there any other kind of meal?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:49am MST	I'm about to eat with my lab, so I will join you guys in this spiritual meal
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:48am MST	We'll eat together in spirit
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:48am MST	It's ok
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:48am MST	Um, since my class is at 12:30. I guess I'll just stay here
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:47am MST	I just realized I wrote PSU
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:47am MST	Dude you said PSU
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:47am MST	Omg you guys are hilarious.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:47am MST	I'm at cactus grill
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:47am MST	PSU right?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:44am MST	I left the table to get food.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:43am MST	Be there in 1 min
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:42am MST	She did it to herself
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:42am MST	Jose I have a table
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:38am MST	Yup that's what he's doing. I told him he's not doing anything wrong, she's the one that blatantly plagiarized, and risked his academic integrity in the process
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:37am MST	Second option sounds best
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:36am MST	So Scott finally got ahold of his professor. He told Scott either he could talk to the girl and turn in his own report and put that she contributed 0% or they could submit the one she did, put that they each did 50% and Scott could email his separately, then the professor would determine whether plagiarism had occurred and deal with her specifically.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:19am MST	That's the struggle
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:18am MST	I am not free at all today üòï
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:17am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:17am MST	Cool
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:14am MST	I'll be there at 11:45
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:14am MST	I'm free now til 12:20 and 2-3:20
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:13am MST	I don't have time I gotta go buy my secret Santa present
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:13am MST	What time?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:12am MST	*raises hand*
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:12am MST	Does anyone wanna eat at PSU later?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:12am MST	It's ok. I accept you.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:12am MST	Another freaking dilemma
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:12am MST	Damn, I'm racist
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:10am MST	That's racist
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:09am MST	But can one truly appreciate the light in life without the dark?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:09am MST	That was it. We just have a lot of issues.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 10:59am MST	Here comes emanuel, bout to drop some wisdom on us
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 10:59am MST	We've had a lot of dilemmas lately.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:33am MST	I would try to talk to the professor personally
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:31am MST	But you can never get in trouble for turning in something plagiarized if you say &quot;this is plagiarized&quot;. Worst that can happen is getting a zero, but you said he wrote another version. So most likely his partner will get a zero/in trouble if anything
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:31am MST	Tell him I'll fight her if he wants me to. Just take her to my ballet recital and I'll fight her after.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:30am MST	Ok know I'm late
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:22am MST	And he thinks he'll get in trouble for turning in something that's plagiarized, even if he's only &quot;fake turning it in&quot;
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:20am MST	Yeah, I told him he should just turn in both, since he already told his professor in advance. But mostly he's freaked out because he thinks he's going to have to confront her or something.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:19am MST	Can her turn in both?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:19am MST	And she's like texting him and emailing asking if it's done and everything
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:18am MST	Only he rewrote the entire assignment so he could still turn it in.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:18am MST	Just let her say she did all of the parts that were plagiarized
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:17am MST	And now Scott is wigging out because he's supposed to turn in the paper at 2, but his partner is supposed to sign it before they turn it in saying what contribution she did.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:16am MST	It's not Scott's fault his teacher doesn't check his emails
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:16am MST	Anyway so Scott emailed his professor, and tried to be as upfront and forthcoming as possible, but his professor never emailed him back.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:15am MST	Wow that was weird. Anyway, they only turned in hard copies, not electronic copies on d2l which is why his professor didn't catch it the first time. But there's no doubt. Like it's copy pasted
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:14am MST	Scott emailed the professor and said he was concerned his partner was plagiarizing, attached the two files, and asked the professor to check turnitin.com or another plagiarism detecting software, because he didn't want to be responsible for plagiarism.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:12am MST	Scott looked at the first project, it also had huge blocks of text copy and pasted without any citations or quotes.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:12am MST	She had a citation section, but it only had like 2 citations. She didn't have any in text citations, no quotes around the paragraph, nothing, just blatant plagiarism.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:11am MST	Except her writing was weird as fuck. Scott googled the first paragraph, and the very first result was a patent, which she copy and pasted verbatim without any kind of citation.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:10am MST	Scott had to do 2 projects with a partner in one of his classes. He did all the drafting and calculations, she did all the writing. She sent him her part of the project on sunday, so Scott could add his drafts and print it.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:09am MST	You guys I need your input on yet another dilemma
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 3:04pm MST	Lol
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 3:03pm MST	I think Emanuel read &quot;can't&quot;
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 3:02pm MST	Why motherfucker?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 3:02pm MST	That motherfucker
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 3:01pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 3:01pm MST	Oh, I emailed Daniel. He said he can make it to the recital.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 3:01pm MST	I have left campus
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 3:00pm MST	I was just there, I have tutoring, I'm going back at 4 though.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 3:00pm MST	Is anyone at PSU?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 12:32pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 12:32pm MST	I might come by idk yet
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 12:24pm MST	For a while.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 12:21pm MST	I'm finished at 3 so I'm probably going home
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 12:19pm MST	Do you know for how long?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 12:19pm MST	I'm gonna go to PSU still
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 12:02pm MST	It sounds made up
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 12:00pm MST	Gittings is a building on the east side of campus
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:52am MST	Also, is anyone still going to PSU today?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:52am MST	Is that a building?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:52am MST	Wtf is that
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:43am MST	Gittings
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:43am MST	Donde?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:43am MST	3:30 Wednesday
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:42am MST	I'm more used to the first one as well
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:42am MST	Has anyone told daniel? Also emanuel where and what time is your recital
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:42am MST	Oh ok. Well I was originally saying the first one but everyone else complained when I said it
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:41am MST	There are two types of secret Santa. The total secret where we all put our gifts in one location then we open them without ever knowing who got them for us, or the exchange where we just give it to the person on the day we choose
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:36am MST	I don't understand the question but I trust Jose.
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:35am MST	Exchange
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:35am MST	Oh a lighter note, are we doing total secret Santa or exchange secret Santa?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:34am MST	I'm way too old for this shit.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:33am MST	Like I still need to finish my paper, it's due next week, then I need to make my poster and present it, then make a PowerPoint and present that
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:32am MST	Think about Christmasy things
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:32am MST	Ugh you guys I don't wanna think about presenting
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:22am MST	Well if Cindy thinks we should be together, I guess I shouldn't fight it anymore
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:22am MST	Lol emanuel has to go by himself. Emanuel you should talk for the entire 50 minutes.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:21am MST	Cindy is playing match maker with you two
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:21am MST	I bet someone from my lab is going to come...
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:19am MST	Oh yeah, I just saw she was B and I was C and assumed. Dammit Cindy.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:18am MST	I would be first if this was alphabetical
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:18am MST	Usually being alphabetically first is a good thing, well at least I'll get it over with
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:17am MST	Jos√© you're presenting with your future wife
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:34pm MST	It's true.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:33pm MST	Cindy wouldn't want me reading that
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:21pm MST	BTW if you ever want to read about someone who has seen and done some shot, read ODB's wiki page, specifically the section about &quot;legal troubles&quot;
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:20pm MST	Old dirty bastard, yes, ok good so we're not that old.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:19pm MST	Dirty old bastard
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:19pm MST	Yes, there is in fact a clan of Wu Tang.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	Doesn't he have a clan?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	Related: are y'all familiar with the Wu Tang?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:16pm MST	Not gonna lie. 9/10 questions I ask you guys is strictly because Scott and I are out of the loop from a hip thing, or we're trying to gauge how old we are.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:25pm MST	Text you tomorrow think
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:17pm MST	But yeah that's what I would do. Like it's way easier and less messy to switch projects than switch labs
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:16pm MST	Scott was asking me if I knew so I said I would ask you kids.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:16pm MST	Damn ok.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:16pm MST	That's too hip for even me
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:15pm MST	No idea
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:14pm MST	Hey real quick what does tyt stand for?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:14pm MST	I need a euphemism for &quot;I don't give a shit about this&quot;
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:13pm MST	I meet with her on Tuesday. I'll talk to her about it then.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:10pm MST	Maybe talk to your PI about a different project then?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:10pm MST	The project. I don't see any point to it.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:06pm MST	Are you just bored with your specific project or the lab in general?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 1:42pm MST	I talked to Cindy, and she said it might be too late.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 1:40pm MST	So you wanna find another lab?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 1:35pm MST	I think my PI thinks I'm dumb and that I have issues understanding stuff about the lab. Thats true sometimes, but for the most part, I think the shits boring so I don't really care about really understanding it. I understand it enough to get by.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 1:33pm MST	What is it?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 1:30pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 1:28pm MST	Guys I have a dilemma
Jose Celaya	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 8:50am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 8:50am MST	Ok yeah that's west awesome thank you
Jose Celaya	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 8:50am MST	They're right next to each other
Jose Celaya	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 8:50am MST	I don't know where west is, but if you're facing the entrance to yavapai, it's directly to your right
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 8:49am MST	Like across the bike path from Yavapai, directly west?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 8:48am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 8:48am MST	It's not a dorm, it's where the agriculture dept is
Jose Celaya	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 8:48am MST	Across street from Gould-Simpson
Jose Celaya	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 8:47am MST	Building right next to yavapai
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 8:47am MST	Hey do y'all know where saguaro is? I think it might be a dorm?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 6:12pm MST	Maybe it's just really bad allergies and I will be all better tomorrow.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 6:12pm MST	Uhhhh why do I have to get sick now I was soooo close to finishing the entire semester without getting sick at all
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 5:29pm MST	We can beat up the cold for you.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 5:29pm MST	Do you think you're gonna make it?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 5:26pm MST	Guys I think it might finally be happening. I think I'm finally catching a cold.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 3:44pm MST	Someone should make sure daniel knows
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 3:41pm MST	I'm good with that
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 3:33pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 3:33pm MST	Lol I think we should exchange them Wednesday like before or after emanuel's recital.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 3:32pm MST	Mostly me
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 3:32pm MST	*uncoordinated
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 3:32pm MST	Guys we're so fucking incoordinated
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 2:59pm MST	Are we all going to emanuel's recital that he forgot to tell us about?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 2:58pm MST	When are we exchanging secret Santa gifts?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 9:50am MST	Yeah. Here in town I like anywhere that has cheap, good drinks and the music isn't too loud. I usually go to shelter, Che's, plush (but they recently changed name and management so idk if they're still good), pockets, and salty dawgs II. Those are usually my go-to places depending on what side of town I'm on
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 9:48am MST	It's not that big of a deal cuz I've been to dozens of bars in europe and Mexico before haha
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 9:42am MST	That's cool. I would offer recommendations but you probably wanna go to cool, hip bars, not dark dingy dive bars
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 9:37am MST	I'm not big on birthday celebrations
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 9:37am MST	Probably just going out to bars, nothing special
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 9:29am MST	Are you doing anything fun today?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 9:29am MST	Holy fuck you guys are up early. Happy birthday fam
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 8:38am MST	Thank you guys!

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 12:17pm MST	Emanuel did you decide you hate us
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 11:43am MST	Yeah, a bday party isn't worth 1500 in red tag fees
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 11:41am MST	Those motherfuckers
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 11:22am MST	Nah we couldn't find another house to host
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 11:20am MST	Paul, are you still doing something for your birthday this saturday?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 11:17am MST	Turn around
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 11:17am MST	Same table as yesterday
Jose Celaya	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 11:17am MST	Olivia donde estas
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 11:02am MST	Im in lab till 2
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 11:00am MST	Ok
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 11:00am MST	I'll head over around noon
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 10:56am MST	I'll be at cactus grill from now until like 1:30 if anyone wants to join me
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 30, 2016 at 8:47pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 30, 2016 at 8:43pm MST	The second one is definitely the best
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 30, 2016 at 8:07pm MST	And here's this one again for comparison. I can't decide which is my favorite
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 30, 2016 at 8:06pm MST	Emanuel look at this dogs face
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 30, 2016 at 12:20pm MST	Same
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, November 30, 2016 at 12:09pm MST	I have class at 2
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 30, 2016 at 12:08pm MST	Sounds good I'll be there
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 30, 2016 at 12:08pm MST	I'll be back from meeting my PI at about 2:20, so I'll drop by then if you're still there.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 30, 2016 at 12:07pm MST	Probably cactus grill but I'm up for whatever
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 30, 2016 at 12:07pm MST	Where at?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 30, 2016 at 12:04pm MST	I'm starving yo who wants to grab lunch with me at 2
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 1:27pm MST	The one day I need my lab to end on time, it ends early
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 1:24pm MST	My class starts at 2 sorry fam
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 1:24pm MST	Anyone free? I have an hour to kill
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 12:40pm MST	cardenaj@email.arizona.edu
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:09am MST	I'll do it right now
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:09am MST	Yeah I didn't mention anything specific about research applications or anything, just my general interests in the scope of microbiology
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:09am MST	Yeah, give me the email again
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:09am MST	Also, Jos√© email my jefe
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:08am MST	I told her the same thing as Emanuel said, but I didn't know what else to say
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:08am MST	And tell her to emphasize her struggles as a female in a stem field
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:08am MST	I did exactly what emanuel did
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:07am MST	She*
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:07am MST	Show that he's smart and a minority and wants to go to grad school and wants to do research
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:03am MST	I mean applications of his knowledge to research, like I talked about computer vision as applied to the detection of cancer from MRI scans
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:03am MST	Specific applications???
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:01am MST	I'd say be honest in the essay questions, show that he's really excited about research. And talk about at least a couple of specific applications he's thought of that he's interested in pursuing. I think I still have my application if he wants to look at it.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 10:58am MST	Guys my friend is applying to MARC, any tips for the application?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, November 28, 2016 at 3:13pm MST	See you in class Olivia
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 28, 2016 at 3:05pm MST	Nvm found one
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 28, 2016 at 2:56pm MST	There are no booths at psu, this is strange
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 28, 2016 at 1:57pm MST	Guys don't be sad but I'm not going to make it to PSU, I have a meeting with Dr. Tischler at 3pm
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 28, 2016 at 11:13am MST	Emanuel's creepy picture
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 28, 2016 at 11:11am MST	Looking at Scott and Cindy
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 28, 2016 at 11:11am MST	A picture of your postdoc
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, November 28, 2016 at 11:11am MST	A picture if Cindy
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, November 28, 2016 at 11:11am MST	A picture if Scott
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, November 28, 2016 at 11:11am MST	A butthole
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, November 28, 2016 at 11:03am MST	ATP synthase
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 28, 2016 at 11:02am MST	A smiling protein
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, November 28, 2016 at 11:00am MST	Two bears
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 28, 2016 at 10:31am MST	I'm trying to make my new poster. And I don't know what to put instead of a picture of a bear.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 28, 2016 at 10:31am MST	Guys.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, November 25, 2016 at 6:16pm MST	Me too
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 25, 2016 at 5:55pm MST	Guys I fucking hate my postdoc.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 5:52pm MST	Ratchet
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 5:51pm MST	I'd be an amazing ass fish Paul
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 5:51pm MST	üçâ
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 4:58pm MST	Also a dead one
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 4:58pm MST	You would be a ratchet fish
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 4:43pm MST	If I were a fish
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 11:37am MST	That appealed to my love fo reggs and potatoes
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 11:26am MST	Emanuel are you seeing this wisdom
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 11:19am MST	I already submitted that shit so I don't remember. It wasn't very good though
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 11:12am MST	What was it?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 10:10pm MST	The last sentence always feels awkward...
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 10:10pm MST	Ugh I have to write the last sentence of my paper.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:36pm MST	You could probably use other protein too like soy protein
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:26pm MST	And whey protein
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:25pm MST	You need bacteria to make cheese.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:25pm MST	Cheese never would have been born.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:24pm MST	Even cheese would be dead?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:18pm MST	It's true. All of our lives would be nothing. We would all be dead
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:18pm MST	My life would be nothing without those bacteria
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	Sweet. You can thank bacteria for that delicious cheese you're eating.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:16pm MST	I am not. I am currently eating cheese.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:11pm MST	Emanuel are you criss-cross applesauce?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:10pm MST	I feel like he is
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:09pm MST	Emanuel are you high and/or drunk?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:02pm MST	Microbes that are chill with people and not trying to kill them
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:01pm MST	Yeah, the bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc in poop
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:01pm MST	Or you want your life to be about poop?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:01pm MST	I don't follow. You want to study poop?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:59pm MST	Yeah but I'm more about the poop
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:59pm MST	That's the cool crazy shit though
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:58pm MST	And those are the only ones contagious enough and deadly enough to worry about. And ebola is the only one without a vaccine, and that's almost done too.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:57pm MST	Nah, I probably don't wanna work with infectious disease. I mean maybe. But very few people really get to work with the nasty shit like ebola or anthrax. And very few people work on smallpox anymore.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:55pm MST	You're not scared you'll accidentally get some crazy disease?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:52pm MST	Yup, or the NIH
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:51pm MST	Olivia, would you be down to work for the CDC?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:51pm MST	Will do
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:51pm MST	Sounds good. Let me know when you get there.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:51pm MST	Yeah I'm gonna be making vaccines and shit.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:51pm MST	With our buckets of money we can buy you a grad school Olivia
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:50pm MST	I'm down to build cool shit
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:50pm MST	You can build cool shit in grad school?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:49pm MST	Nah fam I'm going to grad school
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:49pm MST	Down af
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:49pm MST	We should all build some cool shit together

Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:47pm MST	Guys, I don't want my whole life to be trying to get papers published.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:47pm MST	Oh shit
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:46pm MST	I mean I guess if you change your major to ballet your interview would probably be a dance
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:45pm MST	Grad school interviews are in somethnig other than dance?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:44pm MST	Emanuel this is what you should do when you have grad school interviews
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:11pm MST	Yeah that sounds terrible
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 6:44pm MST	You guys are so lucky you didn't have to write papers during the dark ages of technology

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 3:26pm MST	Right but do I list like 5 and then say et al or 2 or what is the rule
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 3:26pm MST	I would. I don't think you're helping anyone by writing 248 names
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 3:25pm MST	Yeah but even at the end in your list of references?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 3:25pm MST	Et al
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 3:25pm MST	Any idea how you're supposed to reference a paper with 248 authors?

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 11:59am MST	He hates us.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 11:59am MST	I'm not sure if his messenger works, then again he was with his not-girlfriend, so maybe he just likes her better
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 11:58am MST	And he hates us and doesn't wanna come have lunch with us
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 11:58am MST	Yep
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 11:58am MST	He said &quot;it's lit&quot;

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 11:12am MST	Ok. I've just never seen an abstract include funding info. Like I thought the abstract is what gets printed in the program, so you know what posters you wanna visit
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 11:10am MST	I did, at the bottom. Something like: ----Abstract---- Blah Blah Funding: T345A708G5
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 11:09am MST	Did y'all include your funding sources in the abstract? That seems really weird to include in an abstract
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 11:00am MST	I'm on fire

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:42am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:42am MST	Otherwise he's gonna get here and I'm gonna waste all this time trying to interpret his crap.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:42am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:42am MST	Awesome, I'll see you then
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:41am MST	Then I can just say oh well I guess I missed you
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:41am MST	I should be walking out the door at noon. My post doc isn't even here he says he's gonna come by later but hopefully I'll get done before he gets here.

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:39am MST	Ok. Do you just wanna pick me up from umc at 12 so you don't have to wait for me to walk down there
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:38am MST	üçâ

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:38am MST	Maybe I'll get out a little sooner, but definitely no later than noon
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:38am MST	Yup, that's what time I usually finish up in lab
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:37am MST	Around 12?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:55am MST	Anybody want to go to Boston market with me for lunch?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 9:48pm MST	I know. I'm thoroughly enjoying it
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 9:47pm MST	Oh my gosh, I've seen so many of those, now it's not just Kermit
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 9:47pm MST	My fucking dogs.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 9:47pm MST	Mostly imgur.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 9:46pm MST	Haha, where do you find all these?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 9:46pm MST	But in regard to &quot;I'm support&quot;
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 9:45pm MST	Again, Jos√© sorry I'm late.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 7:37pm MST	It's a show from Netflix
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 7:37pm MST	That guy
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 7:33pm MST	Or what?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 7:33pm MST	I'm not sure if I should say who?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 7:33pm MST	Reminds me of bojack horseman
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 7:33pm MST	I know it's late but this is my response to your twinkle twinkle little star meme Jos√©
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 7:32pm MST	I'll pray for you.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 7:32pm MST	That's a good reason
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 7:32pm MST	Cause I'm doing my 252 homework
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 7:32pm MST	But why?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 7:31pm MST	I am also dying.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 7:11pm MST	Still dying...
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:51pm MST	I feel like this dog
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:51pm MST	I'm support
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:51pm MST	I'm support this theory
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:51pm MST	100%
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:51pm MST	I'm support this theory
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:49pm MST	I have already seen the old memes
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:49pm MST	Dammit jose. I am old.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:49pm MST	But it blew my mind a couple weeks ago
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:49pm MST	I found this and wanted to show you guys
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:49pm MST	I know this is old
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:49pm MST	Oh yeah!
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:48pm MST	Jose that meme is so old. I need more.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:48pm MST	Laugh at this
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	But there's nothing to look at. You guys are my only friends
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	That's how I waste time
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	Look through the snapchat
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	That must be a record
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	Somebody kill me. Put me out of my misery.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	He's said it like 27 times in the last five minutes.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	*twerk
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	He subconsciously wants to tweet
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	Wasting away
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	And I'm dying
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	And it sounds like twerk
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	My professor keeps saying tworque instead of torque
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:45pm MST	I'm dying in my physics class
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:45pm MST	Pleasr
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:45pm MST	You guys talk to me.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:27pm MST	Only if you're a good son.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:21pm MST	Will you still beat people up for me?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:09pm MST	Shit
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:09pm MST	That's the last time I offer to beat someone up for you
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:09pm MST	You have a valid point
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:09pm MST	Maybe if her face is all busted up you wouldn't like her as much
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:08pm MST	Damn just trying to help
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:08pm MST	Beat
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:08pm MST	Except Olivia, she just said she could bear her up
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:08pm MST	Damn. Everyone is dropping wisdom
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:07pm MST	When you're in the &quot;fuck her&quot; state of mind, write down reasons why, and read them when you get weak
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:06pm MST	Fuck that hoe
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:06pm MST	You right
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:06pm MST	Donde esta la biblioteca
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:05pm MST	not te dejes
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:04pm MST	Listen to emanuel he's so full of wisdom.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:01pm MST	I always try to stop talking to her but then she talks to me and hooks me again
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 5:59pm MST	I think you should just give her less priority.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 5:26pm MST	You may be right
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 5:26pm MST	It sounds like maybe she just likes the attention
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:30pm MST	Yeah being a guy sounds terrible
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:30pm MST	Every fiber I'd my body wants to tell her to fuck off, but I like her too much to do so. I hate being a man sometimes
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:29pm MST	I would just tell her to fuck off. But we all agree I'm not the most diplomatic person
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:28pm MST	Haha I wish it was that easy. Shes just the most indecisive bitch ever. She tells me that she likes me, then a little bit later she tells me that her feelings changed. Then she tells me she likes me again. She's making my feelings a fucking roller coaster and I don't dig it
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:27pm MST	And just be nice.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:26pm MST	Just tell her to stop being all vindictive.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:25pm MST	Oh you'd fuck her up easily lol
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:25pm MST	*her
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:25pm MST	I bet I could take het
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:25pm MST	Do you want me to beat her ass?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:15pm MST	Yes. She's making my heart ache
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:12pm MST	Do you want me to call her parents?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:11pm MST	Moooommm it sucks
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:11pm MST	I like her. But I don't want to like her. She's plays with my feelings
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:07pm MST	Tell her to quit
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:06pm MST	This one bitch is messing with my feelings
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:02pm MST	Que onda
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:02pm MST	With what?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 3:45pm MST	Guys Im having issues
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:53pm MST	I know. First your jacket now the money
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:53pm MST	Damn look at jose coming in clutch
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:52pm MST	I have a 20
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:49pm MST	I have like 7 in cash.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:49pm MST	Does anyone have $20 I can borrow? I seem to have misplaced my debit card and I need to repay Cindy today
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:47pm MST	Word
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:47pm MST	Olivia, I'm heading over
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:43pm MST	I thank you for that
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:43pm MST	I mean if you wanna go to some random class at 3 I'm not gonna stop you.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:43pm MST	Don't tell me how to live my life
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:43pm MST	Ok that's what I thought
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:42pm MST	2
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:42pm MST	Emanuel you don't have class at 3
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:42pm MST	I also have class at 3. Jose is your only hope
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:27pm MST	Alright I'll see you after then
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:23pm MST	2
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:23pm MST	Yeah I gave class at 3
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:22pm MST	I'm jelly I've been here since like 7:30. You have class though don't you
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:21pm MST	I'm barely heading to campus
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 21, 2016 at 1:00pm MST	I'm at psu if anyone is free
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:51pm MST	I'll pray for you guys then
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:27pm MST	Yeah it sounds reasonable but I also know that I am not really a reasonable person usually
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:25pm MST	That's a reasonable way to go
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:18pm MST	If he owns up to it, then we'll work it out. If not I'll ask him how long he's been smoking and lying to me about it, and it'll be a shit storm.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:17pm MST	He knows I want to talk to him so he already knows something is wrong. When he gets home I'm just gonna ask if there's anything he wants to tell me.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:16pm MST	What're you gonna say to him?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:15pm MST	Nobody else in this house smokes.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:15pm MST	Positive.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:15pm MST	How sure are you that he's still smoking?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:12pm MST	Especially since he supposedly did it as a gesture for me. And it's not just lie by omission, like he definitely went out of his way to conceal it from me, he just got a little sloppy and slipped up
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:10pm MST	I think your last point is very important
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:10pm MST	I realize quitting isn't easy and I'm not faulting him for that but I'm definitely faulting him for lying to me.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:09pm MST	Fair enough Paul, that's how I see it too. When he gets home I'm gonna give him an opportunity to fess up.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:08pm MST	He's at fault for lying, you're at fault for snooping. If you accept your fault for snooping, then I think the lying outweighs the snooping
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:07pm MST	And he quit as a birthday present for me like a year and a half ago, or so I thought
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:07pm MST	Of course I did.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:05pm MST	Did you want him to stop?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 12:53pm MST	Basically he quit smoking only not really and he's been lying to me about it for who knows how fucking long
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 12:52pm MST	Well then it sounds like everything is fine.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 12:49pm MST	Yeah but I feel like I can live with that.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 12:49pm MST	If you snooped, you're 100% at fault for snooping.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 12:48pm MST	How at fault am I for snooping if I was 100% fucking right?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 12:48pm MST	If Scott left something in plain site which made me think he's doing something fucking bad and then I snoop and find a lot of shit that definitely proves he's doing something fucking bad
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 12:48pm MST	Real recognize real
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 12:47pm MST	Ok guys real talk.

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 11:18pm MST	Yup. I legit didn't see it, I wasn't trying to be an asshole. I backed up into an angular spot, but the sign was too tall to see through my back window.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 11:00pm MST	Ouch
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 10:26pm MST	I accidentally got a $400 ticket cause I didn't see the handicap sign...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 9:28pm MST	Por que?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 8:07pm MST	Guys I'm super sad.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 5:17pm MST	I have that thought on a regular basis
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 5:07pm MST	For a smart person, I am dumb as fuck sometimes.

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 4:47pm MST	Basically it's all about using bacteria, viruses, and parasites to treat diseases
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 4:45pm MST	What're you writing?

Jose Celaya	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 2:49pm MST	Always listen to aliens
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 2:49pm MST	I'm gonna say it's an alien.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 2:49pm MST	Listen to that little jumping...whatever it is
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 2:49pm MST	Lol its not the science. It's the writing.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 2:48pm MST	Is this how you feel?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 2:47pm MST	Think about ATP in microbial phages after meosis
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 2:47pm MST	Thinking about Christmas right now definitely isn't helping me write this stupid paper
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 2:46pm MST	Ok that's definitely not making me more productive
Jose Celaya	Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 2:46pm MST	Just think Christmasy thoughts

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, October 21, 2016 at 9:16pm MST	Because he has crohns disease. It's an autoimmune disease, so basically if he doesn't take medicine, his immune system is constantly activated, and attacking his own cells.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, October 21, 2016 at 8:57pm MST	Why does he take things that suppress his immune system?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, October 21, 2016 at 8:24pm MST	He depends on herd immunity, like us healthy people getting vaccinated. If he catches a cold he's sick for like a month
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, October 21, 2016 at 8:23pm MST	That means he takes medicine that suppresses his immune system, so he can't take most vaccines
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, October 21, 2016 at 7:11pm MST	What does that mean?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, October 21, 2016 at 6:53pm MST	Yeah but Scott can't have the flu shot, cause he's immunocompromised
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, October 21, 2016 at 6:51pm MST	Their immune systems suck, so the less people who expose them to the flu the better
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, October 21, 2016 at 6:49pm MST	The flu shot is good for the elderly
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, October 21, 2016 at 6:49pm MST	I am elderly. And the flu will make me die
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, October 21, 2016 at 6:49pm MST	How would you die?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, October 21, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	Do you want me to die paul?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, October 21, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	Uhhh no...
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, October 21, 2016 at 6:45pm MST	Well see who gets sick. What about the rest of you guys you better get your flu shots
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, October 21, 2016 at 6:39pm MST	Lol well if you feel like shit it's because your immune system is kicking the pretend flu's ass
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, October 21, 2016 at 6:34pm MST	Nah, my body is a fucking fortress
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, October 21, 2016 at 6:32pm MST	It's ok. Emanuel did your flu shot make you feel like shit for a day or 2?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, October 21, 2016 at 6:31pm MST	It's awesome

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 5:37pm MST	I mean it's also true about racists
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 5:25pm MST	*rapists

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 4:12pm MST	But I don't have one
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 4:10pm MST	Give the rapist a fleshlight
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 4:10pm MST	Well guys I made it inside the lobby without getting raped or kidnapped but if I get any rapey vibes I'm going home
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 3:37pm MST	I think you have a good enough excuse already
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 3:32pm MST	Go home
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 3:30pm MST	Lol you guys are fucking tempting me...
Jose Celaya	Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 3:29pm MST	It's the only way
Jose Celaya	Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 3:29pm MST	Turn off your phone
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 3:28pm MST	But I'm gonna start driving home then I'll get another alert saying they caught the dude and then I won't have a good excuse

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 3:22pm MST	Great you guys I'm gonna get raped when I go to west campus right now...
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 2:24pm MST	That's exactly why we're doing it
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 2:20pm MST	Idk why were doing secret Santa, all of us are gonna end up getting fleshlights
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 12:49pm MST	Yup. Santa already crossed him off the nice list

Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, October 19, 2016 at 10:29am MST	Jos√© you are literally the only person I know that's run out of gas
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, October 19, 2016 at 10:25am MST	I'm free from 2-5

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, October 19, 2016 at 10:23am MST	So I just filled my tank. After like an hour of running around campus.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, October 19, 2016 at 9:37am MST	Or maybe he's on the first floor because he thinks that's the lobby???
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, October 19, 2016 at 9:35am MST	Or do you think he went to the wrong lobby should I go check
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, October 19, 2016 at 9:35am MST	Goddammit it's 935 where the fuck is he...always fucking late

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, October 19, 2016 at 9:20am MST	I feel bad laughing because Jose's morning has probably been so shitty but it's pretty fucking hilarious, also incredibly lucky that he gave me the spare literally 2 days ago
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, October 19, 2016 at 9:19am MST	Also, rule #1 of pushing cars, roll the window down as soon as your car stops.

Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, October 17, 2016 at 11:32am MST	Tischler is just being a dick because I'm not working directly under Marty with him as my only mentor
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, October 17, 2016 at 11:31am MST	Julio is my PI and the guy I've been working with, Marty is the PI of the entire team and head of the department. Marty officially accepted me from the MARC as his mentee, but then assigned me to Julio based on my research interests
Jose Celaya	Monday, October 17, 2016 at 11:29am MST	Well, Cardenas is gonna be the director, why not just change mentors &quot;officially&quot;. Tischler's being an ass.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, October 17, 2016 at 11:29am MST	Wait so Julio is just your PI not your mentor?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, October 17, 2016 at 11:28am MST	Everyone knew that except him apparently. He said I'm supposed to be working with Dr. Pagel because he's my assigned mentor
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, October 17, 2016 at 11:27am MST	Didn't he already know that?
Jose Celaya	Monday, October 17, 2016 at 11:27am MST	Why?

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, October 17, 2016 at 11:27am MST	Why now
Jose Celaya	Monday, October 17, 2016 at 11:27am MST	But why this time?

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, October 15, 2016 at 7:02pm MST	Yeah I know but what about the technical writing do we have to take that in addition to the colloquium or just the colloquium
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, October 15, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	It's always 'a'
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, October 15, 2016 at 6:24pm MST	Hey do you guys know, for next semester do we take 395a and 395b? Or just 395a?

Jose Celaya	Sunday, October 2, 2016 at 8:50pm MST	Hopefully my 30 minutes alone with him won't be super awkward
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, October 2, 2016 at 8:50pm MST	Or ask for advice
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, October 2, 2016 at 8:50pm MST	He's pretty easy to keep talking, just ask him questions and he'll keep going
Jose Celaya	Sunday, October 2, 2016 at 8:49pm MST	Cool cool

Jose Celaya	Sunday, October 2, 2016 at 1:04pm MST	Nope, they stopped that last semester. You might because you haven't taken 400 level classes before, but I don't think so.

Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, September 19, 2016 at 1:58pm MST	So psu at 3?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 19, 2016 at 12:04pm MST	More like a rave
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, September 19, 2016 at 12:04pm MST	Does your life feel like an orchestra right now?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 19, 2016 at 12:04pm MST	That pretty much sums it up. And I even caught my bus right in time too
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, September 19, 2016 at 12:02pm MST	Now I understand
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, September 19, 2016 at 11:59am MST	Can you describe it to me in a metaphor?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 19, 2016 at 11:56am MST	You guys have no idea how excited I get when I get to leave lab on time and my lab notebook is up to date. It's the best thing ever.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 19, 2016 at 11:55am MST	Then I have no idea.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, September 19, 2016 at 11:48am MST	It was A üòê
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, September 19, 2016 at 11:33am MST	That stairs one is silly
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 19, 2016 at 11:14am MST	That's the only distinction I see, since they're going the same direction
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, September 19, 2016 at 11:13am MST	Ohhhh that makes sense. I was so confused on the stairs one
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 19, 2016 at 11:12am MST	Sorry I'm in lab I just saw this
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 19, 2016 at 11:12am MST	8 is true. Genes are distributed between the strands. And for 9 I'm guessing it's the 2nd one, because it looks about 10 steps/turn aka 10 bases/turn but count them to make sure cause I can barely see in the pic.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, September 19, 2016 at 10:41am MST	Can you provide your wisdom for 8 and 9?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, September 19, 2016 at 10:40am MST	!

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 3:53pm MST	You need me to forward you the email from the summer that had everyone's contact info?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 3:52pm MST	Wildcard needs the numbers
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 3:50pm MST	I volunteer our wildcard to do so
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 3:26pm MST	Omg let me know how that goes
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 3:26pm MST	We could ask little and big Olivia
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 3:06pm MST	Jos√© lives in southern Narnia
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 3:05pm MST	I don't know about anything either.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 3:01pm MST	Jose's house
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 2:29pm MST	I actually have no parties for this weekend

Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 1:40pm MST	I'm down to get lit
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 12:34pm MST	I don't know what's happening but I know I'm down for both getting lit and playing pool.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 12:27pm MST	And nobody is invited.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 12:27pm MST	I'm going home and having a nap party
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 12:26pm MST	Emanuel and I were lamenting the lack of a party and we thought we should use pool to fill the void
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 12:26pm MST	Jos√© can you even read
Jose Celaya	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 12:25pm MST	Guys, play pool with me and Emanuel instead of homework party.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 12:03pm MST	Ok good...I am in desperate need of a serious nap
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 10:24am MST	I would be perfectly okay with no hw party today
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 8:58am MST	And follow up question: are you going to be super sad if we don't?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 8:58am MST	Question for Paul: were we going to have a homework party today?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 2:48pm MST	I think the prayers worked
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:52pm MST	Don't pray to me that's too much pressure I can't grant wishes I'm not a genie
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:47pm MST	Or to you for standing up for women in science
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:43pm MST	Or pray to Rosalind Franklin, since she did most of the work
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:42pm MST	I'm gonna pray to watson and crick for you
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:34pm MST	Don't worry we'll pray. And not that fake ass praying you guys did for me before my test. You got it fam
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:33pm MST	He probably knows some people.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:33pm MST	Alright guys Im about to take my bio test, pray for me
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:31pm MST	I'm sure he can expedite the process
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:30pm MST	Lol what is Jesus the grim reaper now too? He's in charge of taking people who are expired?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:30pm MST	To make him happy you gotta devote your whole life and stuff.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:29pm MST	Not like Jesus.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:29pm MST	I'm gonna tell Jesus to just take Dr. Tischler already
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:29pm MST	Well all you have to do to make Cindy happy is reply to her emails in a timely manner
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:29pm MST	I'd rather have Jesus mad at me than Cindy
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:28pm MST	I'm sure Cindy is already in with Jesus
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:28pm MST	I'm gonna tell him you don't believe in him anymore
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:28pm MST	Lol
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:28pm MST	I'm gonna tell Cindy on you if you tell Jesus on us
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:28pm MST	I'm gonna tell Jesus on you guys
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:27pm MST	You can't prove Jesus is 2000+
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:27pm MST	Show me the birth certificate
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:27pm MST	If you're not even old enough to drink, you're definitely not 2000+ years old
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:27pm MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:27pm MST	Exactly
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:27pm MST	Show my Jesus' birth certificate and I'll believe you
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:26pm MST	By like 2000 years
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:26pm MST	Prove it
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:26pm MST	I'm pretty sure Jesus was born before you paul
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:25pm MST	Mine is before Jesus
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:25pm MST	Dec 22. All the dopest people were born in December. Like me and Paul and Jesus
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:25pm MST	That's good is it before or after finals
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:24pm MST	Si
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:24pm MST	Y'all are turning 21 in December right? Except daniel is turning 21 in February, and jose obviously
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:23pm MST	I'm gonna be 21 on a Saturday

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:22pm MST	That's very true emanuel
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 12:58pm MST	That's how old I'm gonna be on my birthday
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 12:58pm MST	I take naps sometimes in the kachina room on the 3rd floor of the student union
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 12:58pm MST	I wish there were napping stations
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 12:57pm MST	21
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 12:57pm MST	How many credits are you taking again?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 12:50pm MST	This fucking semester you guys...
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 12:22pm MST	ÛæÅî
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 11:46am MST	I think they do
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 11:45am MST	I got hot sauce in my bag swag
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 11:45am MST	It's hit sauce
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 11:45am MST	It's hot sauce
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 11:45am MST	#wildCard
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 11:45am MST	What is that
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 11:44am MST	Does anyone know if CVS sells Frank's red hot?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 11:34am MST	ÛæÅî
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 11:33am MST	ÛæÅî
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 11:22am MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 11:10am MST	ÛæÅî
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 11:09am MST	That sounds reasonable to me.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 10:59am MST	Yeah buts it's all multiple choice, so I think it's safe to assume they all have the same point value, as individual points weren't listed for each question.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 10:58am MST	Two questions can be a total of 12, but they don't have to be 6 individually. One could be 10 and the other could be 2
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 10:42am MST	Because if they were worth 5pts each then 5x19=95 which isn't enough I figure right?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 10:41am MST	Why does each question have to be worth 6?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 10:40am MST	I hope?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 10:39am MST	Yeah I nailed the amino acids part. It was just a ridiculously hard test. But I figure it's worth 100pts, and there were 19 questions, so each one has to be worth 6pts, so there were 114 possible, so I could miss up to 4 and still get an A...right?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 10:37am MST	It's the polar one with the ring.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 10:36am MST	But tire swing...
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 10:35am MST	That bad?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 10:35am MST	Omg fuck that test. I feel like you guys did not pray hard enough.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 9:24am MST	And ATP too
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 9:24am MST	Watch it ask me about every fucking amino acid besides tire swing.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 9:23am MST	Tire swing
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 9:23am MST	I'm about to take my biochem test
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 9:23am MST	What happened?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 9:23am MST	Pray for me you guys
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 7:27pm MST	Haha see? Cause we're bio buddies
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 7:22pm MST	Olivia your study session helped me so much with my next hw assignment. It's all on amino acids
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 7:06pm MST	See people think I'm smart cause I have the amino acids memorized but really I just memorized a bunch of dumb shit
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 7:05pm MST	You're welcome
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 7:05pm MST	Omfg. I'm still in my review session, and remembering tireswing has a ring actually worked to remind me of tyrosine. And iso=1 for isoleucine...
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 2:32pm MST	Psu
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 2:32pm MST	Where are y'all
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 1:22pm MST	#wrekt

Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 1:10pm MST	I'm actually with Olivia on this one
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 12:55pm MST	Ok but y'all better be doing homework or helping Paul and me do homework or so help me god.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 12:54pm MST	I'll go there after my lab meeting
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 12:54pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 12:53pm MST	It starts at 2pm in psu
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 12:53pm MST	But I guess you can come to our homework party.

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 9, 2016 at 12:40pm MST	Too expensive, and way too extravagant.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 9, 2016 at 12:39pm MST	I think you should start with cocaine

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 8, 2016 at 1:04pm MST	*you
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 8, 2016 at 1:04pm MST	How dare yoy
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 8, 2016 at 1:04pm MST	That's exactly what I had in mind
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 8, 2016 at 1:03pm MST	But I'm working hard so you better not come to just distract me with nonsense
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 8, 2016 at 1:03pm MST	Yeah

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 8, 2016 at 12:54pm MST	Me either. But I'm getting used to that feeling in life.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 8, 2016 at 12:53pm MST	I don't understand what she said
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 9:34pm MST	Oh well. That was the jist though right
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 9:33pm MST	Your text is to long to paste. If have to paste ask like 7 parts separately
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 8:19pm MST	Fuckin do it
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 8:19pm MST	I wanna fight tischler
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 8:06pm MST	I texted you emanuel can you paste it cause I'm dumb
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 8:05pm MST	My phone is so stupid it won't let me paste in this convo
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 8:02pm MST	Yeah, that's why I asked Cindy. Let me find that email.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 8:01pm MST	In retrospect it does seem dumb that we specify that we're in MARC to the people who are coming for the sole purpose of assessing MARC.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 7:54pm MST	Idk. I don't have any of them fancy scholarship thingamabobs like you kids.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 7:50pm MST	I already sent it with just MARC
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 7:23pm MST	I asked Cindy if it's lab funding or our marc funding, she said it's our sources of funding. So I just put the MARC grant that we included on our summer posters. But you probably want to include your scholarships I'm guessing?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 7:22pm MST	What's with the sources of training part
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 7:21pm MST	Yeah. Sorry I meant to remind you guys but I forgot
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 6:57pm MST	Did you guys fill out the info sheet?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 3:01pm MST	When are you guys gonna finally fight?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 2:21pm MST	And so is my mentor. We've been busy as shit so he hasn't been able to review it. I'm just gonna send it to tischler like that. Fuck him
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 2:20pm MST	I'm in fuckin NY
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 2:20pm MST	Don't you guys already have it done, like from the summer
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	Friday
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	Sorry, had to vent my response
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	When is it due?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	We have other things too man
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	Me neither lol
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	He sent us basically a rant about how we are being unreasonable and he doesn't have the time. &quot;What's the holdup?&quot; He says.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 2:18pm MST	Ruh roh
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 2:18pm MST	We haven't submitted out abstracts yet

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, September 4, 2016 at 8:42pm MST	And we didn't donate it yet, if anyone wants some dope ass VHS tapes
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, September 4, 2016 at 8:34pm MST	No but I had the lion king.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, September 4, 2016 at 8:34pm MST	Did you have the land before time?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, September 4, 2016 at 8:34pm MST	He made me donate my VHS collection. I still haven't forgiven him.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, September 4, 2016 at 8:30pm MST	I think you guys are he only people I know with a DVD collection.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, September 4, 2016 at 8:29pm MST	He said doesn't everyone have a DVD collection?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, September 4, 2016 at 8:27pm MST	Lol Scott doesn't understand the DVD reference...
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, September 4, 2016 at 8:26pm MST	Were you guys on the same room as your DVD collection?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, September 4, 2016 at 8:25pm MST	Hahahaha
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, September 4, 2016 at 8:23pm MST	I even asked Scott what it meant. I said babe what does it mean to get crossed? And he said like when someone crosses you, like stabs you in the back?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, September 4, 2016 at 8:22pm MST	That's the funniest thing I've heard all day
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, September 4, 2016 at 8:08pm MST	I'm so not hip with you kids and your lingo. I thought somebody like betrayed you or something.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, September 4, 2016 at 5:50pm MST	I like being crossed. It's all the desire to dance of being drunk and all the relaxation of being high.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, September 4, 2016 at 4:23pm MST	Too many handles
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, September 4, 2016 at 4:11pm MST	Que paso
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, September 4, 2016 at 1:52pm MST	Guys I got so crossed yesterday
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 8:23pm MST	Viva M√©xico

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 7:34pm MST	But I'm in california...
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 7:29pm MST	We never drink bowled either. There's so many things we were gonna do drunk that we never did.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 7:29pm MST	Lets do it
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 7:26pm MST	Whatever happened to drunk Pok√©mon hunting ?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 7:24pm MST	I agree with Emanuel
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 6:21pm MST	I think then only me and Paul can have em them. Possibly Jose. We don't know if he's a binge drinker, an alcoholic, or both yet.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 6:19pm MST	Nope, alcoholics always drink alone
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 6:18pm MST	If you've been drinking, you're probably around drunk people, and drunk people are crazy, so you need two sawed off shotguns for your own safety.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 6:16pm MST	Not after I've been drinking, no.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 6:13pm MST	You don't carry 2 sawed off shotguns at all times?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 6:11pm MST	I considered it, but there just wasn't time.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 6:10pm MST	I woulda used one of your guns
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 6:04pm MST	With a rolled up newspaper, a dustpan, and a lot of panicking.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 1:37pm MST	How did you get rid of it?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 1:21pm MST	Scott found it, and dealt a critical blow, trapped it under a plunger and came and got me to get rid of it.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 1:20pm MST	Did you kill it?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 1:15pm MST	Amen.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 1:15pm MST	You need to move before you're devoured by weird animals
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 1:14pm MST	I would've moved the fuck out
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 1:14pm MST	That was in my bathroom last night
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 1:13pm MST	Fuck that thing

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, September 2, 2016 at 10:13am MST	Not me. I'm stuck in my lab reading papers :(

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 1, 2016 at 9:18pm MST	Who's gonna organize the doodle pole so we know when we can have lunch together?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 1, 2016 at 3:03pm MST	I'm on my way
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 1, 2016 at 2:37pm MST	Jos√© and I are grabbing a bite at cactus grill if you guys decide to read our messages
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 1, 2016 at 2:29pm MST	Hey anyone around?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 3:59pm MST	That's so metal.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 2:47pm MST	It's fucking terrible. Your brain basically explodes
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 2:46pm MST	Yeah isn't it terrifying?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 2:46pm MST	Guys I found out how you die from drinking too much water
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 12:36pm MST	No I stayed in my lab 25 minutes late because science never runs on schedule
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 12:34pm MST	So did you miss the bus? Or did your subconscious lead you astray in the hopes that this very scenario would arise?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 12:33pm MST	Yeah it's coming. But I'm still gonna use it as an excuse to not go to my next class I think
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 12:33pm MST	Do you have the app? Can you catch another one that's close?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 12:32pm MST	I missed my bus and now I'm sad :(
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 12:31pm MST	Milk was a bad choice
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 12:03pm MST	It's so fucking hot outside
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 11:42am MST	It's for you, my dead homie
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 30, 2016 at 9:35pm MST	That seems like such a waste.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 30, 2016 at 8:16pm MST	It's ok. This is my life now. I expect these things to happen fairly regularly now that my life has gone to shit.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 30, 2016 at 8:05pm MST	I'm sorry I added insult to injury by spitting all over you
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 30, 2016 at 7:39pm MST	This is my life and I have accepted it.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, August 30, 2016 at 6:33pm MST	Get it together original Olivia

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:58pm MST	*minor I mean
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:57pm MST	You should get a bio minor and I should get a comp sci major
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:54pm MST	My brilliance would be lost on them
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:53pm MST	Why don't you just switch to a bio major jose? You're so full of knowledge.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:53pm MST	You know how messenger DNA is
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:53pm MST	And you had to download a shit ton of RAM to run simulations
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:52pm MST	Omfg
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:52pm MST	If they ask for specifics, just say you're looking at the effects of chromosomal ATP on the fluorescence of various messenger DNA structures
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:52pm MST	Not very collaborative of you...
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:52pm MST	Wow so now only one of us can cure cancer?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:51pm MST	Literally what I do
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:51pm MST	Haha I will.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:50pm MST	Just tell people you're curing cancer
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:50pm MST	Yup
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:50pm MST	So you're at UMC?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:50pm MST	Cellular and molecular medicine...I have no idea what I'm doing
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:50pm MST	Nice, what dept?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:49pm MST	Oh yeah well I have a lab again
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 24, 2016 at 2:49pm MST	Guys, I got a space in my lab. I'm not homeless anymore.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 5:44pm MST	Koffler
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 5:44pm MST	Also, fuck whoever made Kotter 5 stories
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 5:30pm MST	Yeah its stupid as shit
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 5:29pm MST	You had to buy the blackberry?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 5:19pm MST	The new clickers are basically blackberries
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 3:20pm MST	What the fuck Jos√© where are you
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 3:02pm MST	I'm on my way
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:59pm MST	Yeah
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:59pm MST	Upstairs PSU?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:55pm MST	We're meeting upstairs cuz it's better
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:36pm MST	So stupid. Sorry amigo
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:35pm MST	You need a license to use the app because of some Bullshit software update. So it ends up costing a bit too
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:33pm MST	That's shitty. Is your professor using the app at all? It's cheaper than the clicker, if not free, I can't remember
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:33pm MST	I'm at PSU btw, got a table for 4
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:32pm MST	No apparently there's a newer one thats black. I guess I'll be needing that one
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:31pm MST	Uh white aren't they all white
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:30pm MST	Olivia what color is your clicker?
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:22pm MST	Ok cool, I'll head over in a bit.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:22pm MST	I've only been upstairs. I'll go investigate I guess.
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:21pm MST	I was thinking downstairs. But yeah upstairs has bigger tables.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:21pm MST	Do you mean like upstairs? I've only been there like once...
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:20pm MST	I guess so...I mean I have a spot here in the cafe on one of the arm chairs I just don't know where everybody else is gonna sit lol
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	It should be even better now. Wanna meet there?
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	I'm like 5 mins from there in math. When I went at 1 there were a few spots.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	And do you have a spot?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:18pm MST	Are you there?
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:18pm MST	PSU
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:16pm MST	I came to the cafe in ENR2 to get us a spot, cause I have nothing better to do and like every table is full
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:16pm MST	I decided that I hate the regular semester. Everywhere is so nice and empty during the summer.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:05pm MST	How dare you
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:04pm MST	Live with it....
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:02pm MST	But there's no pokestops there...
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 1:53pm MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 1:53pm MST	There's a cafe here?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 1:53pm MST	We should meet at the ENR2 caf√©
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 1:53pm MST	This lecture hall is too big
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 1:47pm MST	I get out right by the MARC class at 3
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 1:39pm MST	So what's up at 3?

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 1:34pm MST	ENR one or two?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 1:32pm MST	ENR is by 6th Street right?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 11:39am MST	ÛæÅî

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 11:17am MST	I'm free at three
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 11:06am MST	It was full when I got there a 9:45. I was late to class. Ûæåπ
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 11:06am MST	Also, idk if anyone is planning on parking in 6th street garage, but it was full when I got here a few minutes ago, fyi
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 10:43am MST	Word. I'm out of class at 2 if anyone is free then.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 10:42am MST	I get out of my psio 201 at three, so we can hang out before Cindy's class if you guys want. And I've been to the class before so I know where it is
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 9:45am MST	ÛæÅî
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 9:44am MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 9:44am MST	Like at 3
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 9:44am MST	I'm free
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 9:42am MST	Like what time?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 9:42am MST	Anyone free before MARC class?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 3:42pm MST	You have to set up your job direct deposit and your refund direct deposit separately
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 3:09pm MST	So you've never gotten direct deposit for refunds?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 3:09pm MST	I get direct deposit for my job, but for some reason not this.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 3:08pm MST	Jos√© you do have direct deposit?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 2:57pm MST	Yeah. Same here. Now I'm just waiting in my refund.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 2:44pm MST	Guys, I just got my dough in the mail
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 2:41pm MST	Emanuel my financial aid was disbursed on uaccess but I haven't received any email yet
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 1:34pm MST	I agree
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 1:18pm MST	We're gonna have to start selling drugs.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 12:34pm MST	I also have nothing.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 11:22am MST	I still have nothing.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 10:02am MST	C.R.E.A.M.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 10:02am MST	Got that dolla dolla bill yo
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 7:36pm MST	Financial aid has a personal vendetta against us.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:29pm MST	This place should be called the restaurant of the best Mexican food and margaritas. Not the little mill.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:28pm MST	Depends what kind of mill you're talking about
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:27pm MST	That's a dumb name. I don't even know what a mill does. Doesn't it make flour or something?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:26pm MST	Yes
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:26pm MST	I don't understand. I'm eating dinner at the small mill?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:25pm MST	It's a damn small mill Olivia
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:24pm MST	I'm trying to bridge this cultural gap
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:24pm MST	Why does nobody care about my question?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:20pm MST	Emanuel the financial aid office hates us
Daniel Osorio	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:19pm MST	Cindy said getting the check by mail would take longer, but I guess it didn't
Daniel Osorio	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:18pm MST	I signed up for it but it was kind of late.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:14pm MST	You don't have direct deposit though right?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:11pm MST	Omg daniel is alive.
Daniel Osorio	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:10pm MST	hey guys, I got my stipend by mail today maybe you can check if its in your mailbox
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:05pm MST	What's a molinito?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:04pm MST	I have 100% faith in Cindy
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 3:57pm MST	Hopefully Cindy comes to the rescue
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 3:18pm MST	Yup.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 2:34pm MST	She's contacting them. School starts Monday right?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 2:33pm MST	What'd she do?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 2:21pm MST	I asked Cindy about it
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 1:47pm MST	You could try to get a ballet scholarship
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 1:46pm MST	I'm gonna have strip my way through college now.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 1:45pm MST	Still nothing.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 1:04pm MST	I have nothing as well
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 9:59am MST	I will pray for your bank account.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 9:34am MST	Nope. Nothing.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 9:08am MST	No email? The direct deposit isn't there yet, just the email.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 9:08am MST	I still have nothing.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 9:00am MST	I got an email saying my direct deposit is processing.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 9:00am MST	Praise the Lord Jesus Christ amen.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 9:38pm MST	Ûæì¥
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 9:37pm MST	Me neither.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 9:27pm MST	I have not.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 9:18pm MST	Has anyone asked Cindy if she knows why we are being cursed to poverty?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 6:20pm MST	It's not a flaw, that's how you say it. Jos√© is going to have to accept when his future wife is right God dammit.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 3:09pm MST	True, you have to be more accepting of your wife's flaws
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 3:08pm MST	Your marriage isn't gonna work unless you can let little things like that go.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 3:07pm MST	Nice initiative
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 3:05pm MST	Oh so you were talking to your future bride already?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 3:04pm MST	No, I asked Marissa, she also pronounces it incorrectly, I was talking about her
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 3:03pm MST	You should just marry her already Jose.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 2:54pm MST	I said stuff about you marrying Marissa, then you brought up Olivia pronouncing &quot;gif&quot; incorrectly. Im missing the link between the two
Jose Celaya	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 2:51pm MST	Why?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 2:51pm MST	I'm confused now
Jose Celaya	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 2:50pm MST	Yeah that's Olivia
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 2:50pm MST	That was Olivia wasn't it?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 2:50pm MST	Besides, she pronounces gif with a hard g, it would never work
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 2:49pm MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 2:45pm MST	*psst* Jos√©, Marissa may be more helpful than you know
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 1:45pm MST	That gif is beautiful
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 1:37pm MST	ÛæÅî
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:21am MST	These financial aid motherfuckers
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:21am MST	Yeah everyone else that I know got theirs like Monday or Tuesday
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:19am MST	I think so too, Scott got his a few days ago...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:16am MST	I think it's the stipend slowing things down
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:12am MST	I don't remember them being this late last year.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:10am MST	Damn.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:09am MST	Lol I don't think so
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:09am MST	Lol can I put food on my bursars account?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:04am MST	I don't know.. I'm super broke too
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:03am MST	Guys where the fuck is our money? I'm so broke....
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 10:53am MST	No it doesn't cover dental I don't think. Emanuel isn't your orthodontist in Mexico anyway lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 10:36am MST	I don't know. Does our insurance cover dental stuff?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 9:35am MST	I can see that. Is your new health insurance going to cover your orthodontist?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 9:19am MST	All I want to do is switch a class so I can make it to my orthodontist appointments. This school is discriminating against adults with braces.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 9:14am MST	It is ass for me as well
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 9:13am MST	Is UAccess ass for everyone or is it just me?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 4:28pm MST	Yeah Scott got his already
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 4:27pm MST	I have a friend who said that hers went through.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 3:38pm MST	Seriously though, we only have two weekdays till school starts. Where is the money??
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 2:17pm MST	I'd have to see to agree. From my observational powers, most people with laptops at the Scented Leaf are actually just here to talk.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 2:14pm MST	I'm just using my powers of observation
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 2:14pm MST	Maybe not if you have a valid claim.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 2:12pm MST	Lol are you disagreeing with me?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 2:11pm MST	Why is that?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 2:05pm MST	Lol I guess so. I'm sitting in the book store right now, and I've decided this school is full of douche nozzles.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 2:05pm MST	Well he's had to be nice to you because of your shitty mentor
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:59pm MST	I don't really mind him all that much
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:59pm MST	He doesn't know the hate that exists for him in the Facebook chat.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:46pm MST	I blame Dr. Tischler
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:45pm MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:44pm MST	That says a lot
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:40pm MST	*financial aid office
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:39pm MST	The financial aid procrastinates more than we do.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:26pm MST	Thank God I'm not the only one. I was starting to freak the fuck out
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:21pm MST	Me either
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:21pm MST	Nope, not yet I'm broke as fuck.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:18pm MST	Have your financial aids disbursed yet?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 7:05pm MST	Jos√© watch those handles
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 7:05pm MST	RIP your battery. I am not in Phoenix.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:55pm MST	Damn. Scott and I fly back into phoenix tomorrow night, and we're pretty sure he left the lights on in his jeep, so we're pretty sure the battery is gonna be dead Ûæå£
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:51pm MST	Unfortunately no
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:51pm MST	Yeah I heard you guys went to the zoo, didn't even invite me. Hey none of you guys are in Phoenix right now are you?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:51pm MST	We saw 3 lions.
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:49pm MST	Btw I saw a lion today
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:48pm MST	For Asian Aslan?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:48pm MST	Like you were revealing a secret fetish that you have.
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	Them too
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	At first glance I thought you said Asians
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	Only if you promise to introduce me to Aslan
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	Fuck yeah! But will you drive me all the way to narnia?
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	Cool. Now I can give you alcoholics a ride when you've had too much half and half
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:45pm MST	Not bad. A little expensive for the mileage, but not too bad.
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:43pm MST	Mostly highway though. Inside is nice and clean
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:43pm MST	208
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:43pm MST	Automatic
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:43pm MST	A lot of miles
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:43pm MST	Hehe
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:43pm MST	Manual or automatic?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:43pm MST	How many miles?
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:43pm MST	I got it for the hair of 3000 dolls
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:42pm MST	Nissan Altima 2004
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:42pm MST	How many doll hairs did you pay?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:42pm MST	What year
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:42pm MST	I got to ride in Jose's car and you guys didn't.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:42pm MST	What kind though
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:42pm MST	This is true
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:41pm MST	What the fuck jose got a car??
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:33pm MST	I don't see it. Was there something important in it?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:08pm MST	Jose did I leave my jimmy johns box in your car?
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 9:06am MST	You there?
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 8:59am MST	How did you get in?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 8:57am MST	*with
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 8:57am MST	The classroom is insulated work recycled jeans
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 8:51am MST	Just got here
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 8:45am MST	Are you at the zoo yet Jos√©
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 7:21pm MST	I'm starting to think maybe you do understand the young people.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 7:14pm MST	Y'all would have been proud of me, drinking entire shots
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 7:14pm MST	That's pretty lit.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 6:34pm MST	I had a whole 6.5 drinks, which is exactly half of what Jos√© requires to get drunk, supposedly.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 5:37pm MST	Sounds like it was 2 turnt
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 2:31pm MST	Lots of alcohol and pretty good music
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 10:41am MST	How was your shot filled night?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 10:38am MST	Me too fam me too
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 10:02am MST	I have been resurrected
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 12:13am MST	Me too
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 12:13am MST	I think he's dead...
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 12:03am MST	It's a watermelon man
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 12:03am MST	Omg emanuel did you see the Google thing?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:44pm MST	I think a shot of half and half has like 500 calories...
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:43pm MST	And calories apparently...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:40pm MST	That's just screaming dehydration...
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:35pm MST	See?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:34pm MST	They are shots though
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:34pm MST	Why not just shots?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:33pm MST	I'm doing shots of cafe patron followed by shots of half and half. It's magical.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:32pm MST	It won't load....I'm so sad
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:22pm MST	Paul, you da real MVP.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:22pm MST	I would send you a gif, but I have shitty service right now.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:19pm MST	Yeah that's &quot;I don't fuck with you&quot; by Big Sean
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:18pm MST	That song???
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:18pm MST	&quot;Lil stupid azz bitch I ain't fuckin wit chuuuuu...I don't give a fuck bitch I don't give a fuck&quot;
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:17pm MST	Probably Big Sean if it's the one I think
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:17pm MST	Do you guys know who it's by?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:17pm MST	Never mind
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:17pm MST	Oh
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:16pm MST	Is it no way Jose?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:16pm MST	It goes &quot;I ain't fuckin wit chuuuuu&quot;
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:16pm MST	Hey guys I'm at the bar and there's a song on
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 12:14pm MST	I would be very happy with you sending drunk gibberish to us
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 11:35am MST	I did after the poster session, but I believe you said you were tired and going home. I haven't been sober enough to communicate with anyone since then....
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 11:33am MST	Didn't invite me or anything...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 11:32am MST	I have to, I barely got sober from the past 48 hours
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 11:31am MST	Wow, go ahead and rub it in why don't you
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 11:31am MST	Physics is so easy though...
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 11:30am MST	Yeah but I'm going to start learning shit ahead of time because I'm legally retarded when it comes to physics.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 11:29am MST	I thought you needed a different one though?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 11:29am MST	You're my hero.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 11:21am MST	Olivia I sent the physics book
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 7:56pm MST	I would send a thanks gif (hard g) but this wifi is not cooperating.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 7:55pm MST	Alright. Thanks.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 7:53pm MST	Maybe you could just put in some logic like if the last 100 partial sums were 0.001 or less apart then stop. But yeah I'm not sure how to figure out how fast that'll happen
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 7:50pm MST	Yup.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 7:50pm MST	Oh, you wanna know how long you need to run it.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 7:49pm MST	I know it converges. I wanna know when it's pretty much converges. It's output from my simulation.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 7:28pm MST	I believe so. What is the series?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 5:58pm MST	And that tells me if it converges at all right?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 5:07pm MST	Also, Paul could you email me the pdf of that physics book pretty please?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 5:02pm MST	But you don't have a formula, just a series? Is it short?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 4:53pm MST	You could compare it to one you do know, use the integral or ratio tests etc
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 4:39pm MST	Enlighten me
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 4:05pm MST	I do
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 3:18pm MST	Does anyone know about testing to see if a series whose formula we don't know converges?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 2:59pm MST	I'm sure she'd tell you the perfect number of avocados to put in guacamole in return
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 2:34pm MST	Lol maybe I should teach her, I got it right away
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 2:34pm MST	It was so hard for me to explain this to my mom in spanish
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 7:55pm MST	I can can personally vouge for her grandma. She does not support eugenics.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 7:50pm MST	Marisa will accept you
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 7:31pm MST	It's ok though we like you.
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 7:31pm MST	I agree
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 7:31pm MST	You're so fucking weird Jos√© lol
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 7:28pm MST	Perhaps it's destiny, you might have met your end on that cursed bike ride, and the flat saved you. Nevertheless, we'll all pray for your tire.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 7:27pm MST	I'm so sad. I came home, took a nap, then I was super looking forward to a bike ride...but I had a flat tire :(
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 11:24am MST	By chick fill a
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 11:22am MST	D√≥nde est√°n?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:39am MST	Shame on you
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:38am MST	I thought lunch was going to be at 11:30, not 10:30
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:38am MST	Yep. I'll be heading to campus in about 20 mins. Just tell me where you guys are then
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:37am MST	Jos√© you coming?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:33am MST	After I was the one that asked for lunch from first Ûæ∞ë
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:33am MST	The stomach wants what the stomach wants
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:33am MST	Yeah we're here.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:32am MST	We thought you guys were sleeping...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:32am MST	Are you at least still there?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:31am MST	Not anymore
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:31am MST	Are you guys eating already?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:25am MST	You could say that
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:24am MST	Is anyone ready for lunch?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:24am MST	Heading to cactus grill
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 9:21am MST	Kk
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 9:14am MST	Ok, I'm by the gym north of the student union now
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 9:14am MST	After o print my poster, I'll head over there.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 8:58am MST	Damn. I got here way too early apparently.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 8:58am MST	On the way to my lab to pass the final gauntlet
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 8:57am MST	I'm on my way to the pokestop trifecta. Where are you
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 8:56am MST	Yeah
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 8:55am MST	Is anyone else here yet?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:28pm MST	Word
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:27pm MST	Also I say cactus grill. Boston market is delicious but makes me incredibly tired
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:20pm MST	I also think we should get drunk.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:18pm MST	I know a guy
Jose Celaya	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	This can be arranged
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	And do drugs
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	Boston market or cactus grill
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	Also we should get drunk
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	I'm down
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	I think we should eat lunch
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:07pm MST	My lab told me to work on it over the weekend and print it in the morning
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:07pm MST	The guy who hates us
Jose Celaya	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:06pm MST	Who's the traitor?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:06pm MST	That's why I was asking
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:06pm MST	Are we all going to eat lunch together before the poster session, like the last supper?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:06pm MST	I think 4 by 8, so 2 posters for side by side but don't quote me.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 8:46pm MST	Wtf Emanuel Ûæå¥
Jose Celaya	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 8:44pm MST	Anyone know how big the boards are that we're putting our posters on?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 8:43pm MST	Early as fuck so I can get my poster printed.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 8:43pm MST	What time are you guys heading to campus?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 8:04pm MST	They never specified, but my uncle said same as the grad school thing, business casual
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 8:03pm MST	What's the dress for tomorrow?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 11:01pm MST	I thoroughly enjoyed this.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	Transfer it to a floppy disk. Oh and lastly you have to delete system 32. Then reboot your computer and bam. Now you should have 32 more gigs of ram than when you started.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 9:16pm MST	Then you have to go to www.google.com and search for download ram. Just torrent the file. You might have to unzip it first.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 9:14pm MST	First you have to open Linux and make sure that there aren't any updates you have to install.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 6:35pm MST	How do you download stuff? Specifically, how do you download RAM?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 6:04pm MST	Like an Internet pirate that knows how to download stuff and reflect things in powerpoint.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 6:04pm MST	BTW, that's me if I was a pirate.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 6:03pm MST	Lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 5:14pm MST	Got it!
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 4:57pm MST	If that makes sense?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 4:57pm MST	But move it across to the other side
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 4:57pm MST	I think you just click and hold the image in the corner like when you resize it
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 4:56pm MST	I don't remember
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 4:56pm MST	Lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 4:54pm MST	Olivia, how do you reflect images?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 6:48pm MST	We need to show everyone so they know they need to stop making Arthur memes.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	Since we were talking about Arthur the other day
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 12:20pm MST	I know just don't leave yet
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 12:19pm MST	We are already here
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 12:16pm MST	Don't leave me behind!
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 12:16pm MST	*coming
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 12:16pm MST	Guys wait
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 12:16pm MST	I'm xing right meowth
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 12:11pm MST	We invited you
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 12:10pm MST	You guys hate me! You're going to cactus grill without me Ûæçç
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 12:03pm MST	Olivia so do you hate us too now?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:57am MST	Cactus grill forever
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:56am MST	So jelly...I love cactus grill
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:55am MST	Im at cactus grill now
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:55am MST	I might be able to make it. My mentor is actually in my lab for the first time in over a week so I can't really duck out right this second...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:40am MST	Also there's a farmers market outside of my lab
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:36am MST	Right? I'm just trying to spend time with you guys since we didn't have class Wednesday
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:34am MST	Jose and Olivia, I know you guys are on campus too. If you hate me and Paul just say it.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:32am MST	Lol alright. I'll leave in like ten minutes then.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:29am MST	Ok I'm gonna start walking but it will take me like 20 minutes to get there lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:29am MST	Cactus grill
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:29am MST	Dope. Where you wanna go?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:28am MST	I'm down.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:28am MST	Anyone on campus for lunch?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:28am MST	I'm hungry but I don't have a car...
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:25am MST	That's exactly what happened. My soul left my body yesterday
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:18am MST	Hahaha
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:04am MST	^this happened
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 9:02pm MST	I'm not sure. I thought of life alerts. Someone else needs to think of the equivalent
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 8:16pm MST	Lol what's the 17 year old equivalent to life alert?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 8:14pm MST	Guys, I see we all pitch in for Olivia's life alert and the 17 year old equivalent for jose
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:48pm MST	Don't get my hopes up
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:42pm MST	I know what we're gonna get you for your next birthday
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:41pm MST	I'm like old and shit, I could have broken a hip or something.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:41pm MST	It was the worst thing that's happened to me pretty much all week.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:40pm MST	RIP Olivia
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:28pm MST	And I was trying to ride next to the pole without going into the dirt but then I started veering into the dirt and I was going down hill and I don't have handbrakes only coaster breaks and then there was this palm tree all of the sudden that I had to swerve not to hit and I was going so fast and I fell and almost died.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:26pm MST	And I was riding right and there's like this bump for the gate of the park, like a metal track, and then a speed bump, then there's this tiny gap on the sidewalk because there's one of those stupid poles
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:25pm MST	It all happened so fast. Scott and I were riding to Agua Caliente to hatch our eggs and catch more poliwags, and we were riding into the park entrance.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:20pm MST	Lol how?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:19pm MST	I fell off my goddamn bike
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:16pm MST	What happened?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 6:53pm MST	Omg emanuel it finally fucking happened
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 4:32pm MST	Same
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 4:28pm MST	I'd be down, but I'm probably gonna have to work on my poster
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 3:44pm MST	Is anyone going to the mhd presentations tomorrow? I'm thinking about it so I wouldn't have to go to lab...
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 3:19pm MST	I could probably do a study on that.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 3:18pm MST	I might take a shit on this poster when I don't need it anymore
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 2:49pm MST	Ugh that's the worst.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 2:48pm MST	She said the figures themselves are all fine but the whole poster needs to be revisited with the question in mind
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 2:46pm MST	What about your nice straight lines did they like those?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 2:46pm MST	Did they shit on you again?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 2:45pm MST	I hate this poster more the more feedback I get.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 2:28pm MST	Sent
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 1:40pm MST	paulhacosta@email.arizona.edu
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 1:39pm MST	emanuelb@email.arizona.edu
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 1:38pm MST	Apparently my email doesn't remember you guys, I need an address
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 1:37pm MST	Ok hold on
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 1:37pm MST	Same
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 1:37pm MST	Olivia, can you forward me the email Sophia forwarded to you
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 1:18pm MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 1:18pm MST	Emanuel that has to be your first car
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 12:30pm MST	But my mentors department paid, not MARC
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 12:30pm MST	The glossy is $45, matte is $20. He also said the glossy starts to fade after 8-9 months
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 12:29pm MST	$45
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 12:29pm MST	How much total did you spend for the glossy?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 11:08am MST	Seriously though, the glossy is worth the extra $25 it looks way better
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 11:08am MST	Got my poster printed guys. Dr. Tischler said it was EXCELLENT and gave me a smiley face
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 6:46am MST	I did. It's required for ABRCMS, otherwise I wouldn't have included it because it makes it look so wordy
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 10:45pm MST	I did
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 10:44pm MST	I'm going to
Daniel Osorio	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 10:27pm MST	hey guys, did you include your abstracts in your posters?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 9:16pm MST	Guys I'm so dumb. I just sent my poster to tischler because my mentor is finally content with it, so I sent an email asking tischler if he could review it, and I forgot to attach it
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:44pm MST	MARC coming up clutch with the funding
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:30pm MST	Off
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:30pm MST	I have scholarship and only 7k in debt, but with MARC I'm gonna pay that debt odd
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:25pm MST	I don't have a scholarship. I also have more than 20K in debt üôÅ
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:21pm MST	Isn't pretty much everyone besides me on scholarship?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:20pm MST	Yeah I figured it would at least help some of you a little
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:19pm MST	Well that's good. I appreciate that. My Pell grant runs out this year and I'm already like 20k in school debt :(
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:18pm MST	Yeah so it would've been greedy for me to take any other help
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:17pm MST	Aw thanks. Aren't you on scholarship?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:17pm MST	Just wondering, because I declined all tuition help so that you guys could get more
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:16pm MST	Roger that
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:15pm MST	Affirmative
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:15pm MST	Why?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:15pm MST	Yeah
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:15pm MST	Did Cindy tell you guys how much tuition help youre getting from MARC?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:10pm MST	I'm packing up and then I'm gonna head over
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:09pm MST	We could move if you need an outlet
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:08pm MST	There's one at the copy center, not far.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:03pm MST	By an outlet?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:57pm MST	Next to it yeah
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:57pm MST	Are you guys still in between the three stops?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:55pm MST	If I need someone to be nice to me, I'll call him or my mom
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:47pm MST	My mentor would be nice to you
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:47pm MST	Yeah, my mentor, the grand mentor
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:46pm MST	The Mentor?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:45pm MST	ÛæÅî
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:45pm MST	I have to get feedback on my poster from the Mentor
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:44pm MST	Jubilant instead of happy and now despise instead of hate. Smh
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:42pm MST	Emanuel, will you ever return to the 3 pokestops? ... Do you despise us?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:32pm MST	*chat
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:32pm MST	Marissa and OliviaTwo are missing out not being in this group char
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:28pm MST	lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:28pm MST	It just says you need to tell people enough so that they know what the fuck you're talking about
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	That doesn't say you have to label a part as the introduction
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	Hang on
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	&quot;Introduction should provide enough information to tell the reader the significance and your hypothesis/claims&quot;
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	I would really appreciate that
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	Do you want me to send a pic?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:26pm MST	I may have lost that...
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:25pm MST	Agreed. But it's all in the 2nd handout that he gave us
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:25pm MST	I don't think it helps for my poster. Like half of it is intro and think it's dumb to have half of my poster in one box
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:25pm MST	I definitely feel like it helps
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:25pm MST	I dont see why an abstract and an intro are both necessary
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:23pm MST	I think I have all of those parts. I don't think labeling them helps though
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:23pm MST	Up stairs no less
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:23pm MST	I was walking!
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:23pm MST	Dammit jose I just saw you walk past me and I tried calling you why do you never check the group chat.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:23pm MST	Walking downstairs
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:20pm MST	Sorry lol I was walking I would have done it sooner.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:20pm MST	Oh okay thank you for catching me up
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:20pm MST	Jose I'm walking downstairs I'll meet you by the pokestops.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	Even though the email Cindy sent us said that our layout, etc was up to us and our mentors.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	Tischler told sophia that we are required to include an abstract, intro, methods, etc on our poster
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:18pm MST	Im so lost
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:17pm MST	Another random question. You guys going to the MHD colloquium?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:17pm MST	I think it's because ABRCMS requires it.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:16pm MST	Did I miss something is that message random?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:15pm MST	I think why Tischler says an intro is important is because it has to be thorough enough so that the rest of the poster makes sense
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:14am MST	Ok I'm coming too
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:14am MST	Yeah
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:14am MST	Emanuel are you still in McClelland?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:13am MST	If I get there early get to leave early
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:13am MST	What emanuel said
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:13am MST	That's no fun
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:12am MST	Going to lab
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:12am MST	What are you guys doing instead
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:12am MST	Im never gonna forgive Holly
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:11am MST	This is dumb as shit
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:11am MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:11am MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:11am MST	I'm on my way too.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:10am MST	Goddammit I just pulled in.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:10am MST	God damn it. I just got to class
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:10am MST	Holly just emailed us. Apparently Cindy didnt tell us
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:10am MST	What seriously?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:09am MST	Well, looks like no class today
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 9:45pm MST	I'll pray for your sleeps
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 9:45pm MST	May your sleeps be plenty
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 9:44pm MST	I'm about to get so many sleeps
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 9:44pm MST	Not enough sleeps
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 9:43pm MST	I think you need to use the sleep, because that made no sense.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 9:42pm MST	I guess I wont be get as sleeps as I wanted
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 9:32pm MST	As far as I know yeah, nobody said that there was no class
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 9:13pm MST	Do we have class tomorrow?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 12:07pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:56am MST	Right. Tell your lab person thanks for nothing, and thank you for the picture of a rainbow emanuel it was very thoughtful of you.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:56am MST	Some people are blind to colors. Some people are blind to thankfulness
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:54am MST	She didn't even thank you Emanuel
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:53am MST	I just remembered I do know someone, I just texted him.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:52am MST	They seem pretty far away
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:52am MST	Damn. I need more colorblind friends...
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:51am MST	http://designbycoffee.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/colors.jpg
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:51am MST	He's kinda busy
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:50am MST	*too
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:50am MST	Can you ask him if these are two close? Cause my color scheme is on fleek and I don't wanna change it if I don't have to...
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:47am MST	He said it's hard to distinguish between colors that are close to each other on the color spectrum, so colors far apart are good for them
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:47am MST	A guy in my lab is
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:44am MST	Dammit.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:43am MST	I am not
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:29am MST	Yes lol I wanna make sure it's colorblind friendly right?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:26am MST	Are you asking that cause you're working on your poster
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:23am MST	Are any of you guys colorblind?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:09pm MST	It's too late for that much wit
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:57pm MST	That might be the whitest thing I've ever read
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:56pm MST	It's bed time. Buenos nachos amigos.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:56pm MST	Not exactly
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:55pm MST	Adventure time?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:55pm MST	That's good cause you guys know what time it is...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:55pm MST	That was the gif that started it all
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:51pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:44pm MST	Those were all on purpose.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:44pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:44pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:44pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:44pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:44pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:44pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:44pm MST	ÛæÅî
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:44pm MST	You've disrespected the sacred watermelon
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:41pm MST	That last watermelon was a lie, disregard it. I almost dropped my phone and pushed it accodentally.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:40pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:37pm MST	Omg lol Paul I want you to remember this gif when you take Dr. Pimentel's mcb181 class because that's basically what he looks like.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:34pm MST	I approve this message
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:34pm MST	Hahaha
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:34pm MST	It's not relevant now, but that doors open, and it's too funny to pass up
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:31pm MST	Now I feel like I can post this:
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:30pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:30pm MST	Yeah maybe you should donate one to me, I hear you're full of shit.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:28pm MST	Maybe you need a fecal transplant
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:25pm MST	Yeah I don't mind waking up early I feel super productive when I do I just have to go to bed early too. Like there's probably something wrong with me lol I don't think that's normal
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:24pm MST	If I don't get enough sleep like more than one day in a row, I get headaches, I feel dizzy and nauseous, I get muscle fatigue...
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:24pm MST	I like waking up and working when I know everyone is sleeping. It makes me feel like Mike Tyson
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:23pm MST	I would be like physically ill.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:23pm MST	Oh god. No.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:23pm MST	I got like 5 or 6 sleeps last night, and I felt great
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:22pm MST	I need at least like 8 sleeps every day but sometimes I get 9 or 10 and it's soooo good. Y'all will understand when you're old like me.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:22pm MST	I can help but respect that.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:21pm MST	It's the best. I get so many sleeps.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:21pm MST	Do you like having a bedtime?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:20pm MST	I was but Scott is taking me home cause I started getting cranky. Cause it's past my bedtime you see?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:20pm MST	Are you pokemon going right now?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:19pm MST	Like 9pm. Sometimes 8:30
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:19pm MST	When's your bed time?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:18pm MST	I have a bedtime every night. And pokemon go has been drastically interfering with that.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:15pm MST	Olivia you have a bedtime on Saturday?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:15pm MST	Fair enough, we actually like to keep the slut count down, it can get messy if there's too many
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:13pm MST	I'll tell you what, I'll stay up past my bedtime, you guys can Skype me and I'll take a shot with you,
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:13pm MST	Most of the girls I know aren't very slutty, so not that high
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:12pm MST	You can still invite whoever, they just need a percentage to adjust their calculations. We take partying rather seriously haha
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:09pm MST	Lol
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:09pm MST	Emanuel my friends are forcing me to ask this, what is the likelihood of you inviting slutty girls?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:04pm MST	Idk it's probably past my bedtime...
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 8:35pm MST	Will do. Olivia are you going?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 8:17pm MST	Also, keep me updated on the number of people haha
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 7:41pm MST	Yeah that's fine, as long as it's the 2:1
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 7:38pm MST	But for real though, I was thinking basically anyone I can across. You guys are trying to make it big thing, yeah?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 7:35pm MST	ÛæÅî
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 7:34pm MST	We could promise to play work
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 7:34pm MST	You think we could get to come
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 7:31pm MST	Cindy Neal?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 7:31pm MST	Who did you have in mind?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 7:30pm MST	As long as it's a 2:1, and they're somewhat social, go for it haha
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 6:01pm MST	Paul, do I have permission to invite people to your party if I maintain the 2:1 ratio?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 5:17pm MST	Olivia, I agree
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 5:17pm MST	My mentor sent me a revised version at 5:01 ü§ò
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 5:15pm MST	I don't know why were submitting them so early, the ABRCMS website says they're not even due til September 9th
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 5:03pm MST	I'd say probably not
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 5:00pm MST	Yeah, I turned it in but emailed Cindy that I don't have final approval. You don't think they'll get printed right away?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 4:59pm MST	My mentor read mine but my PI didnt
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 4:54pm MST	Yeah
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 4:52pm MST	Did you guys have your PIs review your abstract?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:52pm MST	Oh right, duh.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:52pm MST	Nah the second girl has glasses
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:51pm MST	Is that the same girl?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:50pm MST	You coulda said no way jose
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:19pm MST	(This is your moment Jos√©, your one opportunity...)
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:15pm MST	(Jose this is your chance)
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:15pm MST	...
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:12pm MST	But you know who is?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:12pm MST	I'm not DD material though, trust me.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:12pm MST	We'd be drunk, so we wouldnt complain
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:03pm MST	Plus Jos√© still hates us.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:03pm MST	Whose gonna drive you drunk kids around? My car is too little.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:02pm MST	Probably never.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:01pm MST	When is drunk Pok√©mon hunting happening?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II5cDUsUnBw
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	Jose, I assume youre referncing this song
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 2:14pm MST	I am. It just seems weird
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 2:13pm MST	Still use we.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 2:13pm MST	That's what im using. But it seems like it would be weird considering its gonna be an entry with just our picture and just our name
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 2:12pm MST	Oui
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 2:12pm MST	We
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 2:12pm MST	When you talked about your work, did you say &quot;I&quot; of &quot;we&quot;
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 1:53pm MST	Lol not that I know of. He is gonna give me feedback on my poster though.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 1:51pm MST	* to say that
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 1:48pm MST	Did your uncle tell you that
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 1:47pm MST	Lol no Google did.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 1:47pm MST	Did you uncle show them to you?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 1:47pm MST	Nope, I took them out. I looked at the abstracts from 2nd year marc students and they didn't have any in theirs.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 1:44pm MST	Did you have in text citations?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 1:43pm MST	That's what I put.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 1:43pm MST	Jose i think you should get drunk
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 1:30pm MST	By program, do they mean MARC ?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:08am MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:08am MST	Which we are apparently not...
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:08am MST	He wants to go get drunk with his FRIENDS
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:07am MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:07am MST	He just doesn't wanna get drunk with us because he hates us
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:07am MST	See he's drunk already
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:06am MST	Paul got a 6 on the writing, we should be giving him a harder time. I can count to twelf but I can't spell it
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:05am MST	Well excuse us. Not all of us got perfect 170s on the quantitative GRE. Some of us can't even count to 12.
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:04am MST	Keep up guys
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:04am MST	I was estimating. I've never been drunk
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:04am MST	Right? That's what I thought too
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:03am MST	I'm confused, I thought Jos√© could drink 12 shots before he gets drunk?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:03am MST	So I asked Dr. Tischler for feedback, and he said he would submit as is, so I guess you don't need references.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:01am MST	See, he doesn't want to
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:01am MST	Of course I do, I just can't
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:00am MST	Emanuel, Jos√© doesn't want to get drunk
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:56am MST	I haven't started
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:26am MST	I don't really know....
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:21am MST	Do you guys have sources in your abstract???
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 8:06am MST	Plus you broke your pinky promise so you're still dead to me until you fix that...
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 8:06am MST	Lol yeah? I had a lot of pokemoning and postering this weekend, my bad...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 8:05am MST	Olivia you're alive!
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 8:05am MST	Or any day really.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 8:03am MST	Jos√© don't be late today
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 31, 2016 at 1:12pm MST	I'll need it.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, July 31, 2016 at 1:08pm MST	I'll pray for you ‚òù
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 31, 2016 at 1:07pm MST	Pretty much.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, July 31, 2016 at 1:05pm MST	Damn... Sooo main problem is you have to tell your mentor that you fucked up?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 31, 2016 at 1:04pm MST	I thought the poster was due tomorrow, and I told my mentor that. These past few days have been a scramble to get done during which my inattention to detail has become very apparent to my mentor. The good news is that I have more time, but the bad news is I have to tell again that I fucked up.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, July 31, 2016 at 1:01pm MST	What happened
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 31, 2016 at 1:01pm MST	Guys, I dun goofed
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 10:09pm MST	I did. The they asked me if I had caught any Pokemon in the lab
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 9:55pm MST	Did you tell them fuck yeah?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 9:43pm MST	My lab asked me today if I played pokemon go
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 9:42pm MST	I'll take that as a no
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 9:39pm MST	We just got here
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 9:39pm MST	Did you catch anything dope?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 9:22pm MST	You can't see me right now but I'm praying for you
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 9:07pm MST	Cause I had a chance to go
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 9:06pm MST	But why...
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 9:06pm MST	Yeah
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 9:05pm MST	So you ran a red light?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 9:05pm MST	I crossed a street before the crossing thing told me to
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 9:04pm MST	What did you do?!
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 9:04pm MST	I would been down if I wasn't busy getting pulled over on my bike
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 8:47pm MST	Finally heading to Reid park if anyone wants to come
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 8:21pm MST	I would lose my dog in the stream in he went outside
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 7:26pm MST	So many broken promises and crushed dreams.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 7:25pm MST	My street is literally flooded lol
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 7:25pm MST	I can't hear you over all the broken promises
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 7:14pm MST	Too much rain
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 4:34pm MST	If anyone *cough* PINKY PROMISE *cough* would like to go pokemon hunting tonight Scott and I are going later, haven't decided where yet
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 11:12pm MST	http://brobible.com/life/article/pennsylvania-town-devastated-dunkin-donuts/
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 7:34pm MST	Then I have nothing for you
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 7:30pm MST	What if we want a real tattoo
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 7:01pm MST	It's my way of saying if yall ever want a fake tattoo, I know a girl haha
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 6:59pm MST	Is this your way of avoiding telling us you're not going to hunt pokemon with us ever?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 6:58pm MST	Point being, hands down the best artists I know
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 6:57pm MST	She also does henna though
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 6:53pm MST	Ahhhhh ok I was gonna say henna is like a dark red/brown
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 6:50pm MST	It's jagua, it's a fruit similar to the henna plant but whenever I say jagua ppl don't know wtf I'm talking about.. But it's the same concept
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 6:49pm MST	That doesn't look like henna
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 6:48pm MST	Best henna artist I know
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	I don't understand...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 6:45pm MST	That's ok, I'm still eating dinner
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 6:44pm MST	It's cuz I'm not even out of lab yet...
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 4:46pm MST	The pinky has lost its meaning
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 3:58pm MST	It's like pinky promises don't mean anything anymore...smh
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 3:58pm MST	See emanuel I told you he wouldn't come.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 3:57pm MST	I live 15 minutes from campus the exact opposite direction
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 3:56pm MST	Psh that's like half of what I drive to get to campus every single day, and that's only one way.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 3:54pm MST	That's so far...
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 3:53pm MST	It's next to golf n stuff, in &quot;narnia&quot;
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 3:53pm MST	Also, I don't regularly check Facebook
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 3:53pm MST	Don't expect me to make a Google survey for every event.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 3:53pm MST	Where tf is that?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 3:53pm MST	It's not like I sent you a Facebook invite or anything
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 3:51pm MST	Trail dust town!

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 10:25am MST	You think this is a fucking game
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 10:25am MST	I was walking down university and I saw it on the sidewalk
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 10:25am MST	Where'd you get that????
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 10:38pm MST	Scott and I are going pokemon hunting in trail dust town, just saying.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 10:38pm MST	Uhhh tomorrow?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 10:37pm MST	This.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 10:37pm MST	ÛæÅî
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 10:37pm MST	Paul, when are we going Pok√©mon hunting ?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 9:41pm MST	I've been too lazy to click on every Pok√©mon individually
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 8:01pm MST	Better use an egg. Did you transfer some in and get candies so you could figure out how many you have to evolve??
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 8:00pm MST	Also, whoever picked that orange color was a monster.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 8:00pm MST	I have yet to evolve all my Pok√©mon from last time.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 8:00pm MST	And we already know Jos√© hates all of us, so why would he care about my livelihood
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 7:59pm MST	I appreciate that Paul. I think emanuel was just happy the storm sabotaged me so he could have a chance to catch up to me level.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 7:57pm MST	I prayed for you and all your Pokemon Olivia
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 7:57pm MST	I'm with Jose on this one
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 7:56pm MST	THANK YOU PAUL. Jeez people these days don't know how to recognize an emergency when they see one...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 7:23pm MST	That was bad Jos√©
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 7:07pm MST	Power restored, crisis averted.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 7:06pm MST	Because it is.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:57pm MST	The sky by your house likes like the evil version of Narnia
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:50pm MST	I thought it was something bad too. Its not raining at all here.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:34pm MST	Also no cooler. No food. We're gonna have to drink all the beer before it gets warm
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:33pm MST	I appreciate your concern Jos√©. According to Scott, one time the power was out for 5 days
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:32pm MST	So this is it. This is how it ends.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:32pm MST	And pretty soon I won't be able to text, because I just have my battery and my backup battery.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:31pm MST	Like you actually leaving or something
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:31pm MST	Olivia, I literally thought it was something bad
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:31pm MST	I can't work on my paper cause I can't charge my laptop
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:30pm MST	This storm...we came home and there's no power, which means no Internet
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:30pm MST	Well guys I don't know if you can read this but it was nice knowing you.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, July 26, 2016 at 12:30pm MST	Ok cool, thanks
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 26, 2016 at 12:30pm MST	I asked Cindy if I still have to send it in even though my lab is printing it and she said no
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, July 26, 2016 at 12:29pm MST	Cindy said she'd email us info about it
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, July 26, 2016 at 12:29pm MST	No, but do we have to email it to anyone just like the paper?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 26, 2016 at 12:29pm MST	Are you having MARC print it?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, July 26, 2016 at 12:28pm MST	Guys, do we turn in our posters tomorrow?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 26, 2016 at 10:23am MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 9:45pm MST	Palabra.

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 7:12pm MST	Are you still coming Paul?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 4:34pm MST	I'm there.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 4:34pm MST	If my car will start
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 4:34pm MST	Ok go by the cashier, by the elevator I'll pick you up
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 4:33pm MST	I'm by the stupid rocks
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 4:26pm MST	I'm packing up. I'll meet you at the garage.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 4:25pm MST	Yup. Walking out the lab now
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 4:25pm MST	Yeah. Are you?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 4:24pm MST	Are you ready fam?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 4:20pm MST	Sounds Gucci
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 4:18pm MST	We could hit up tucson mall, hunt for a while, then maybe have some redddddd robin
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 4:17pm MST	I don't know. You guys are the Pok√©mon shamans
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 4:16pm MST	We can meet at 6th Street garage, but Scott is asking me where we should go.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 4:14pm MST	Like where are we meeting or where are we looking for Pok√©mon?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 4:13pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 4:09pm MST	So for real though where are we going, I'm finishing up in my lab...
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 3:56pm MST	So Paul is coming pokemon hunting too then???
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 3:15pm MST	Psh Jos√© won't come with us, if he hates us too much to go pokemon hunting, then he definitely hates us too much to go to Seattle
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 3:14pm MST	When we go to Seattle
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 3:12pm MST	If we ever go to Seattle though...
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 3:12pm MST	Oh, no I won't be joining. And no I don't hate anyone.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 3:11pm MST	Does that mean what I think it does?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 3:11pm MST	Paul, did you say we?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 3:11pm MST	I think we need more than 10:30 to go to Seattle...
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 3:09pm MST	Is jose coming? Did you tell your parents 10:30?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 2:53pm MST	2 down
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 2:49pm MST	Road trip?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 2:47pm MST	I second that
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 2:46pm MST	Seattle
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 2:29pm MST	Where do you wanna go?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 2:25pm MST	It's happening as soon as I finish in the lab
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 2:18pm MST	What's the deal with Pok√©mon hunting?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 12:12pm MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 12:04pm MST	ÛæÅî

Jose Celaya	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 11:33am MST	Oh, and shareLatex has word count. And technically if you pay you can collaborate with people. I don't do that though
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 11:32am MST	So I can access it anywhere, doesn't take up space on my computer and I don't have to worry about installing the and setting up anything
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 11:31am MST	Easier than on your machine. But if you do want to do it on your machine I'd say texMaker
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 11:31am MST	Why not do it offline?
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 11:31am MST	I do it online
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 11:31am MST	ShareLatex

Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 24, 2016 at 5:46pm MST	Jose, what electronic music should I listen to if I want my mind blown?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 24, 2016 at 10:47am MST	Exactly
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 24, 2016 at 10:45am MST	Did you have to throw tacos at them instead of razz berries?

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 22, 2016 at 7:30pm MST	Well jose hates everybody, plus his mom probably wouldn't let him out to play anyway.

Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, July 22, 2016 at 4:05pm MST	Did you guys turn in the methods yet?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 22, 2016 at 4:00pm MST	There's a hitmonlee north of the tree ring lab for 7 more minutes.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 22, 2016 at 10:45am MST	But yeah, it's just the methods

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:44pm MST	Omg. You guys are killing me.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:43pm MST	&quot;Can we get a prenup?&quot; &quot;No way Jose.&quot;
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:41pm MST	#JoseAndMarissaForever
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:40pm MST	I think Jose will end up supporting her
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:40pm MST	I think Jose should be her sugar daddy
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:40pm MST	Or she's thinking long term. We're probably gonna have decent jobs in the future. She's building the foundation for relationships
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:36pm MST	Obviously not us, but networking will get her a promisingly rich husband
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:35pm MST	Sounds like he's a perfect sugar daddy
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:34pm MST	I kept looking at him thinking I was gonna have to do cpr
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:34pm MST	When I met him for our meeting, we had to walk up a flight of stairs and I wasn't sure if he was gonna make it.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:33pm MST	Omfg lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:33pm MST	Who though? Out of all the guys, I think the only one who could potentially make her a trophy wife right now is Dr Tischler
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:31pm MST	Perfect gateway to find a guy who can support a trophy wife
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:30pm MST	There goes emanuel, asking the real questions
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:30pm MST	If Marissa wanted to be a trophy wife, why would she be in MARC?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:28pm MST	But it's so magical.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:28pm MST	I'm glad I don't live in Narnia
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:16pm MST	That's gross

Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 19, 2016 at 6:32pm MST	I also tend to excel at eating
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 19, 2016 at 6:32pm MST	I'm good at cramming
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 19, 2016 at 6:10pm MST	Is anyone good at cramming?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 19, 2016 at 6:09pm MST	I'm good at eating...
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 19, 2016 at 6:08pm MST	I don't know about you, but I'm pretty damn good at cramming and eating.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 19, 2016 at 6:07pm MST	I'm not confident in anything that involves our combined mind power
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 19, 2016 at 6:06pm MST	I am confident that if we put our minds to it, we can play Pokemon, eat, and cram all at the same time.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 19, 2016 at 5:05pm MST	I haven't truly started playing though
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 19, 2016 at 5:00pm MST	I'm down to eat after class tomorrow

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 3:16pm MST	Maybe you'll get a dope lab where you can get started right away
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 3:13pm MST	So I don't know what I'm gonna do about my poster session in August or the conference in Tampa....like I said fuck my life
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 3:12pm MST	Damn. That blows
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 3:12pm MST	I have to meet with Dr. Tischler, they might have me switch mentors because mine isn't teaching me shit
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 3:11pm MST	But why Olivia?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 3:11pm MST	Hahaha it's fuck that puto
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 2:55pm MST	Also file transfer protocol
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 2:52pm MST	That's what I thought. Also fuck my life
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 2:50pm MST	Is that what FTP stands for?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 2:49pm MST	What did they do?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 2:35pm MST	Fuck the police?
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 11:06am MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 11:06am MST	FTP Indeed
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 11:06am MST	FTP
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 11:05am MST	I literally just looked at all the papers I'm referencing, their references are out of order. The one my mentor wrote that we're basing this off of has all the references out of order.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 11:03am MST	No but still
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 11:03am MST	Did he tell you to not have any figures too, Paul?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 10:56am MST	Fuck that guy
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 10:35am MST	Yup
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 10:35am MST	Did Dr. Tischler discourage all of your figures?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 4:25pm MST	I assumed we all loved the GRE
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 4:06pm MST	Have I mentioned how much I hate the gre?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 3:25pm MST	Thank you. Its working
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 3:10pm MST	I'm praying for you
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 1:36pm MST	I am hungover as shit
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 12:35pm MST	I'm gonna practice my gre now I'll bbl
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 12:35pm MST	Not too shabby. You can get lapras, aerodactyls, hitmonlees, dratinis, and other cool shit from 10km
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 12:34pm MST	A 110 Onyx
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 12:34pm MST	What did you get????
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 12:33pm MST	I hatched one of my 10km eggs
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 12:29pm MST	I think that's a good idea.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 12:28pm MST	No but maybe we could take a poketrip there tomorrow
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 12:28pm MST	Has anyone gone to the testing center?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 12:27pm MST	Yeah same here.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 12:27pm MST	I should do that. I have yet to write an essay
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 12:25pm MST	Ah. I'm about to finally take one of the computer practice tests for the gre...
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 12:24pm MST	He hasn't yet.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 12:23pm MST	Lol he didn't send you feedback?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 12:23pm MST	I just sent him my references. Hopefully he doesnt try to fight me
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 6:11pm MST	Whoops
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:56pm MST	I left them as little reminders for what to put in the references at the end.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:54pm MST	Yeah that's gonna be no bueno...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:54pm MST	That's no good...
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:54pm MST	Yeah.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:53pm MST	Emanuel do you still have in text citations but no references???
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:53pm MST	No I mean the group meeting
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:52pm MST	Ohhhh ok I thought you meant you guys talked about something one on one.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:52pm MST	He said a lot of stuff about my references and said there was no excuse for them to be bad even though we only talked about that for like 10 minutes
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:49pm MST	Wait Paul I don't get what you're saying. And yeah, Emanuel, yeah definitely.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:49pm MST	I didn't even include a references section. I assumed that would come at the end, but now that I think about, that was not the right move.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:46pm MST	I like how he talked about it one and in my paper he wrote &quot;in our meeting I clearly said there was no reason to make these so inconsistent&quot;
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:20pm MST	He shat on my references section but didn't mark up too much otherwise
Daniel Osorio	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:15pm MST	same, mine were mostly on the references
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:14pm MST	Did he give you a ton of corrections? He marked up paper almost everywhere but said &quot;generally very good&quot;...?
Daniel Osorio	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:13pm MST	I did
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:02pm MST	Did any of you guys get feedback from dr. Tischler yet?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 10:04am MST	Scott apparently doesn't remember saying that, I reminded him, he said wow I say some good shit.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 10:00am MST	Hang on let me ask him
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 9:55am MST	Are these the dick straws?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 9:37pm MST	We gotta take a gym over
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 9:13pm MST	Yup I caught it

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 9:10pm MST	Yeah but you're gonna find others. What did you get
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 9:10pm MST	It's too late. I already evolved NY evee
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 8:47pm MST	Force evolution for Eevee https://imgur.com/gallery/vbQR6
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 8:47pm MST	Omg emanuel
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 6:51pm MST	We're gonna have to get him to call himself
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 6:50pm MST	Especially Jos√©
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 6:49pm MST	Even jose?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 6:42pm MST	Ok. The next time I see one of you guys you can teach me how
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 6:41pm MST	Already done
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 6:38pm MST	And it's pretty much the greatest thing I've ever heard. I think we should make it our ring tone for when jose calls us
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 6:38pm MST	So I finally just watched that video cause I got home to my WiFi.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 5:15pm MST	With a lure on it...
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 5:15pm MST	So I told Scott I would take him to dinner tonight since I've been playing so much pokemon and ignoring him. And I'm waiting in the parking lot. And the restaurant is a pokestop...
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 4:33pm MST	That sums up my feelings perfectly
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 4:31pm MST	https://youtu.be/3DpYYUEhoUM

Jose Celaya	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 4:22pm MST	It perfectly captures how I've felt many times before

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 4:21pm MST	Well, I got a smiley face because I apologized for sending it so close to the deadline, and he said like &quot;That's ok, it's still on time :)&quot;
Jose Celaya	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 4:21pm MST	I'm dropping out
Jose Celaya	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 4:21pm MST	He hates me

Jose Celaya	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 4:20pm MST	Ok, that was long, but I had to vent a bit
Jose Celaya	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 4:20pm MST	We emailed back and forth 7 times. I sent a PDF since I didn't write it in word, and he asked me for the word copy. I had some of my methods in there, that troubled him, and my file was called UROC_2016_Paper and he took the time to remind me that it was a MARC specific assignment.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 4:18pm MST	Ruh roh
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 4:17pm MST	He sent an email to me and Sophia saying that our intros were due in less than an hour
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 4:14pm MST	Dr. Tischler sent me a smiley face.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 4:13pm MST	I just sent in the old one.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 4:03pm MST	I believe in you.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 4:02pm MST	I'm gonna see how many of the edits I can get in before 5.

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 3:21pm MST	My mentor just gave me a shit ton of feedback

Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 10:54am MST	No, it currently has 3 evolutions and the last one is Drake so far
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 10:51am MST	So you're saying Lil Wayne is the final form? That's kind of disappointing...
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 10:50am MST	We won't know what Drake evolves into until they release the next 150 rappers.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 10:31am MST	Lil Wayne evolved from 2 chains who evolved from Chamillionaire
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 10:31am MST	Actually he is a Pok√©mon. He evolves into drake.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 10:24am MST	I didn't know Lil Wayne was a pokemon trainer
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:32pm MST	I don't really feel an urge to do so...
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:32pm MST	How are you gonna out level Jose ?

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 10:41pm MST	I can't see that one...
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 10:18pm MST	I was trying to only use gifs, but I think im all out
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 10:10pm MST	It actually happened.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 10:10pm MST	OMFG
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 10:09pm MST	I found no joy in this...
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:46pm MST	But have you ever tried it?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:45pm MST	I can't get on board with eggs coming out of the nipples
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:44pm MST	That's significantly less interesting.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:43pm MST	It's more like that
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:40pm MST	Is that what you look like when you're making them?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:40pm MST	That's incredibly disturbing but also a pretty accurate representations of what its like when I eat eggs
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:38pm MST	Omg emanuel I saw this pic and it made me think of you.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:36pm MST	This is exactly what I was telling you yesterday!
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:36pm MST	Team Instinct be like: https://imgur.com/gallery/Qc402MJ
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:36pm MST	Everything. It all went downhill from the very first step when we weighed out the samples and apparently we did that wrong.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:34pm MST	What did you do wrong?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:33pm MST	Yeah. But we did all wrong and have to do it again tomorrow. My mentor thinks I'm a mindreader
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:33pm MST	Examing poop?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:31pm MST	I know but I'm so tired, I was in my lab til 7 today...
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:31pm MST	We need to go out at night and get ghost pokemon
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:29pm MST	Yeah but you should probably play it anyway
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:29pm MST	Well I mean if you want to be a fire goose that's up to you emanuel. You do you booboo.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:28pm MST	For the record I'm not against the immaturity of it, I just don't find it appealing is all, if that shit was Dragon Ball related it would be a different story
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:28pm MST	I can't decide between red or blue. I have blue clothes, but I like the red teams mission
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:26pm MST	Riiiiight. Go fucking watch some judge judy.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 9:25pm MST	Go suck a bag of pokedicks Ûæå¥Ûæå¥Ûæå¥ I'm dying Ûæå¥

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 4:09pm MST	Let's do it
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 2:21pm MST	*Then we can do the same thing over and over
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 2:20pm MST	Basically we pick a starting point and have people go in each cardinal direction, take a certain number of steps, and then see who got closer to it. Then we do that again, starting where the people who got closer to it stopped. Then we can do this over and over.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 2:16pm MST	Yes???
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 1:16pm MST	I have an idea for getting closer to pokemon that are near by
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 10:17pm MST	But maybe you should...

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 10:19am MST	You guys are ridiculous. Is anyone else coming to study with us tonight?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 10:18am MST	This is a fun group message
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 10:11am MST	I will wait for you here in the AC. I'm by pink berry
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 10:07am MST	It might take me some time to walk there lol
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 10:06am MST	I just got out. Somewhere in the Union with AC
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 9:53am MST	ÛæÅî

Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 7:55am MST	My presentation is at noon, thanks though
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 6:46am MST	No sorry but if you want I can listen to it after lab around 5
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 11:47pm MST	Sounds good.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 11:35pm MST	Probably the union
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 11:32pm MST	I'm free. Just let me know where.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 11:29pm MST	I needed to practice a presentation

Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 2:53pm MST	I've been called the gif wizard
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 2:42pm MST	Paul you are the greatest. I can't see the last one that jose sent though...
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 1:34pm MST	You kids and your moving pictures
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 12:44pm MST	Jose I would be really happy if you reacted to that in a gif
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 12:41pm MST	No way Jos√©
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 12:31pm MST	If we make it, you're going to have to an apple phone so you play it
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 12:28pm MST	Don't be getting my hopes up
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 12:27pm MST	Open up XCode, look up &quot;iOS Development Tutorial&quot; and make the next Pokemon Go
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 12:26pm MST	Lol thanks
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 12:21pm MST	Jose, do you know how I code for apps?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 12:10pm MST	You guys should start a FindMyMicrowave app
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 11:52am MST	On the ground floor
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 11:52am MST	Near the bathrooms, next to the pinkberry
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 11:51am MST	Cactus grill has one
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 11:43am MST	Do you guys know of a microwave at the student union?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 7:20am MST	No but I brought my tablet so I can write directly on it. Scott disconnected the printer...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 7:17am MST	So did anyone print it?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 10:50pm MST	If only my printer had ink
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 10:41pm MST	Probably?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 10:40pm MST	Do we have to print it?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 10:34pm MST	Especially for 8am...
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 10:34pm MST	It looks really involved
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 10:19pm MST	Holy shit did you guys get this handout for tomorrow's presentation?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	I don't feel like I can make career decisions in this state.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	I don't know about that. I burnt my hand taking food out of the oven, so today is pretty much the worst day ever.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:15pm MST	Not with that attitude. I think if you tried cheescake, you can do anything
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:11pm MST	Lol I'm not sure I'm qualified.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:10pm MST	You should start a pokemon go advising firm
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:09pm MST	Wow. Yeah people are dumb. You don't actually have to go inside anywhere to catch pokemon...
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:07pm MST	They just got kicked out for not buying anything.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:03pm MST	I almost ran over some people using that app because they crossed a light without the walk sign
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:02pm MST	Me too. They almost asked to to unplug my laptop charger to charge a phone.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:01pm MST	Lol ambushed?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:00pm MST	I'm starting to dislike that app
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:00pm MST	The coffee shop I'm in just got ambushed by a pokemon go squad
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 1:32pm MST	CrossTrek
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 12:41pm MST	I don't think that was it...
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 12:41pm MST	Mini Cooper
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 11:46am MST	Paul what was that car you were talking about instead of the Subaru outback
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 11:13am MST	I'm not sure about all that. All I know is I'm about to eat so much breakfast
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 11:11am MST	Cheese cake is a slippery slope to having to be bailed out of jail.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 11:09am MST	Scott is freaking out cause I told him I tried cheese cake yesterday and I didn't like it
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 11:08am MST	That would've been a good idea
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 11:02am MST	So I definitely think we should have eaten dinner...
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 1:09am MST	I made it all the way to Narnia and didn't die
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:51pm MST	You might die
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:48pm MST	12 shots is a lot
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:40pm MST	Probably not, I'll get whatever Paul says
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:39pm MST	Are you gonna get a mini Cooper?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:39pm MST	And I'll be 18 in 5, we can test the 12 shots theory
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:39pm MST	Haha, I get a car in one month, I'll do 10:30 then
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:38pm MST	I told you you shoulda said ten thirty
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:38pm MST	Have a good time I presume
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:38pm MST	Wow, you guys were serious about 10:30
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:35pm MST	You guys still there?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:34pm MST	Wait, literally?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:34pm MST	Olivia is passed out
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:33pm MST	You know what Olivia and Paul wanted to say?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:32pm MST	Greetings
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:32pm MST	Hi Jose
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:28pm MST	Paul, Olivia
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:20pm MST	Jos√©
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 9:47pm MST	Jos√©
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 6:42pm MST	Ok just checking
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 6:41pm MST	Nooo. Nothing Mexican unless it's dos equis
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 6:40pm MST	Negra modelo?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 8:55am MST	Just got here
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 8:54am MST	I'll be there soon
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 8:54am MST	Dude where are you guys
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 8:38pm MST	Pikachu will always be in my heart.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 7:38pm MST	Don't even speak to me.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 7:38pm MST	My love for pokemon died when I stopped watching the pokemon vhs movies
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 7:09pm MST	You guys need to download this app already
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 7:04pm MST	I just caught a ponyta in my fucking bedroom fuck yeah
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 6:52pm MST	Rude. He's actually adorable, very chill
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 6:52pm MST	That thing is evil
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	His name is picasso
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	I thought you would never ask.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	I demand a picture of the new pet
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 6:37pm MST	No he won't play pokemon with me Ûæå£
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 6:37pm MST	Pokemon don't count as pets
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 6:37pm MST	I feel like you guys are not sufficiently excited about this news
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 6:34pm MST	Guys Scott got me a new pet!!!
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 6:34pm MST	Ok I can do that
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 6:21pm MST	Olivia, I never gave you money for the barbecue. You need to take my money.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 5:24pm MST	They underestimated peoples' love for Pok√©mon
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 5:16pm MST	Apparently. And it's been way overloaded
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 4:59pm MST	Do all the Pokemon go people use only one server?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 4:47pm MST	Exactly. I can't catch pokemon cause the stupid server...
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 4:46pm MST	There's too many typos to save any meaning for that message.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 4:43pm MST	Que?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 4:41pm MST	That server has ironically l probably had a ridiculous amount of traffic
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 4:34pm MST	And the stupid server is down :(
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 4:19pm MST	I know but I forgot it......
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 4:17pm MST	ÛæÅî
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 4:17pm MST	You should get one of those chargers you can carry around.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 4:10pm MST	We gotta go somewhere interesting though like the mall or 4th ave. But my battery is only 63% ....
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 4:10pm MST	ÛæÅî
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 4:10pm MST	ÛæÅî
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 4:10pm MST	Because we are all beautiful. I'm down
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 4:09pm MST	But why again? And why didn't holly mention it I don't understand. Are we gonna catch the pokemons?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 4:09pm MST	Maybe we're gonna have really fast group pictures
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 3:26pm MST	And why do we have to meet with Kathryn Kellner twice...
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 3:26pm MST	I'm confused though, Holly just sent an email saying we have to be in ILC 150 on Monday at 8:30 but my calendar says were supposed to have more group photos at 8...
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 3:25pm MST	Maybe hunt for more pokemon if they fix the server.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 3:23pm MST	Do you guys wanna do something today?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:59pm MST	Holy shit that's perfect. You are the gif wizard
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:55pm MST	We need a gif to prepare Olivia for fighting a mountain lion
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:45pm MST	Gifs are harder to find than ppl think
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:40pm MST	I can't find an appropriate gif for that.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:34pm MST	It gets stuck in my teeth though
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:30pm MST	Now you're just showing off
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:29pm MST	I'm eating a mango
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:29pm MST	In so bored I started washing dishes and studying for the GRE
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:24pm MST	I'm sorry. It's almost my bedtime
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:24pm MST	I'm bored now so....
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:22pm MST	Real heros
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:20pm MST	Yup.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:20pm MST	That girl is weird though
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:20pm MST	And now I cant.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:20pm MST	Was my description accurate?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:19pm MST	Oh hey I can see it now.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:19pm MST	Very vivid eyebrow movement
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:18pm MST	Quick someone describe this gif to me.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:18pm MST	I don't know what this and it makes me uncomfortable
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:18pm MST	It won't let me paste...
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	ÛæÅî

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:15pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:12pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:12pm MST	Now I'm gonna send messages twice all the time.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:11pm MST	Actually, I think I've gotten one of her messages twice before.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:10pm MST	It's okay. At first I thought you just had the same response to different things and it somewhat made sense
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:09pm MST	Lol sorry?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:09pm MST	This confuses me lol
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:09pm MST	Yeah my Internet is ghetto...
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:08pm MST	Not me.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:08pm MST	Doesn't anyone else get Olivia's messages multiple times?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:08pm MST	That's hilarious.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:05pm MST	There is one a few blocks away called &quot;hidden fountain&quot; and it is literally a bird fountain in my neighbors yard. Like I drive by it every day on my way to campus
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:04pm MST	Did you download it yet
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:04pm MST	Are there those things where you can get pokeballs and eggs?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:57pm MST	I don't know I can't go outside!!!! I feel like we've been over this.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:57pm MST	Are there actually pokemon by your house?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:56pm MST	....I'm just gonna stay inside and catch more pokemon tomorrow
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:56pm MST	*not catching
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:56pm MST	*legendary Pokemon
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:55pm MST	It's better than getting mauled by a mountain lion
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:55pm MST	I vote sawed off
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:54pm MST	Yeah no. The recoil will destroy me.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:54pm MST	Wha if we get you a sawed off?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:50pm MST	Yeah but I'll only have one hand free and I'm not shooting a 20 gauge onehanded...
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:49pm MST	Take your shotgun
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:48pm MST	You guys want me to die.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:48pm MST	No we just want you to have the strongest Pokemon. Getting eaten is just an occupational hazard
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:47pm MST	You guys want me to get eaten by a mountain lion.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:47pm MST	They're legendary. That's why they're so hard to catch.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:46pm MST	You just have to believe
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:43pm MST	I don't think so
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:43pm MST	The mountain lions are Pokemon too
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:33pm MST	Yeah, I wanted to walk around my neighborhood and look for pokemon but Scott won't go with me and I don't wanna get eaten by mountain lions.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:32pm MST	You turn on your location, then walk around and find poke balls and catch pokemon and go to gyms to fight and train and stuff.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:32pm MST	Some white kid will end up in the hood with that
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:31pm MST	I've heard about it, is it like virtual reality or something like that?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:30pm MST	But have you SEEN pokemon go?
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:29pm MST	I only play pokemon stadium
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 7:54pm MST	Him and jose are probably off playing pokemon go together, that's why they couldn't study gre with us
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 7:54pm MST	I've seen him looking at the messages in the chat.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 7:52pm MST	Nope haven't heard from him...
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 7:49pm MST	Has anyone heard from daniel lately? I feel like he might be dead
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 7:45pm MST	Your dog is adorable

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 5:26pm MST	Who actually wants to and is able to study besides me

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:46pm MST	Shhhhhhhh
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:45pm MST	We have less than two weeks right?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:38pm MST	Yeah...I haven't looked at it in like a week.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:33pm MST	I have to little drive to study for it. All i wanna do is nothing when I get home.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:29pm MST	Don't say those letters...
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:28pm MST	I actually have a lot of fun doing it, but it's not very conducive to GRE studying
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:26pm MST	That sounds way less depressing, actually.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:26pm MST	My life has turned into watching hours of scrubs and eating cheeseburgers
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:22pm MST	Because this is my life apparently
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:22pm MST	Why?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	Yeah....
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:14pm MST	Are you wanting it again?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:11pm MST	It's so depressing. I watched it last night already
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:10pm MST	That sounds very depressing
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:09pm MST	It's about the genocide in Rwanda during the 90s.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:08pm MST	It's about the genocide in Rwanda
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:08pm MST	I have no idea what that movie is
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:05pm MST	Yes.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:05pm MST	Guys Hotel Rwanda is on. I'm pretty sure this is one of the most depressing movies ever made.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:05pm MST	?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:05pm MST	Bird's the word

Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:53pm MST	Exactly
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:52pm MST	The life of appropriate kitchen utensils?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:52pm MST	I left that life behind when I got into MARC
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:52pm MST	So how are you planning to eat the giant watermelon
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:51pm MST	That I can't do. I don't have one.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:51pm MST	Lol but then you'll have to carry a giant knife too to cut it
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:50pm MST	I will get up extra early to walk it to campus
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:49pm MST	Lol will you take it to campus on your bike?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:49pm MST	If we're actually gonna eat it, I don't mind being the idiot carrying a watermelon all day
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:48pm MST	So we have a snack.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:48pm MST	You should probably bring it to our study group tomorrow
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:47pm MST	If that's weird, I don't wanna be normal
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:47pm MST	It's a good place for rags.

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:29pm MST	ÛæÅî
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:29pm MST	Whoa, Paul your watermelons are different
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:29pm MST	Aw that's kinda worth it maybe
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:28pm MST	It's a cute little dog eating a watermelon
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:28pm MST	I need some dumb thing called gif keyboard to see your gif Paul is it really worth it..
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:23pm MST	ÛæÅî

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:22pm MST	Thank you, someone got the joke
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:22pm MST	And Jos√©, yes it is actually.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:22pm MST	Yeah but that's just because you don't have a PhD. Once you finish grad school you'll label all of your poop.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:22pm MST	ÛæÅî
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:19pm MST	I don't have much to add. Feces isn't my shit.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:18pm MST	I like how Jose just observes
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:18pm MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:17pm MST	I second that also
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:15pm MST	That sucks though.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:14pm MST	I second that
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:12pm MST	To be fair, I don't label any of my feces either.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:06pm MST	And then he had a super hard time trying to standardize a pH meter which I've never even worked with but read the instructions and figured it out in like 5 minutes.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:06pm MST	Like wtf are you going to do with unlabeled feces cause you sure as fuck can't publish anything with it, you can't even tell if it's human or not.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:05pm MST	Sorry I was eating delicious nicos. Anyway, the freezer was super messy, like unlabeled vials of actual shit, some containers were broken, there were just hundreds that we had to sift through and they were just randomly thrown in bags.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:58pm MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:57pm MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:54pm MST	Emanuel asks some good questions
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:44pm MST	Why?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:43pm MST	The other person. It was such a cluster fuck. I'm now convinced I made a horrible decision picking my mentor
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:42pm MST	Did you do inventory with you pi or the other person?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:40pm MST	Yup
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:40pm MST	So you protected yourself from poop?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:33pm MST	Chemicals mostly. But we also inventoried the freezer which is full of fecal samples
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:26pm MST	What were you protecting yourself from?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:17pm MST	Personal protective equipment
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:10pm MST	What's ppe?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:09pm MST	I got to mix stuff together, and wear ppe
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:08pm MST	I figured out where an equation came from all on my own.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:06pm MST	Sciencing tired me out too much today
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:00pm MST	I got to science
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 6:59pm MST	So I fell asleep too... In lab

Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 6:57pm MST	Unfortunately, no. I went home and instantly fell asleep.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 6:55pm MST	My spirit. Did you eat with my spirit?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 6:55pm MST	There's what?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 5:37pm MST	So there's that.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 4:47pm MST	I ate there for lunch. But my spirit it still there.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 4:46pm MST	I'm gonna eat at illegal Pete's if anyone wants to join
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 4:26pm MST	I agree.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 4:24pm MST	Maybe we should wait til tomorrow
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 4:19pm MST	It doesn't look like they're gonna let me go anytime soon so I don't think I'll make it
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 4:06pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 4:06pm MST	Almost done guys
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 3:36pm MST	Well if he ever fucking texts me back I'll let you know

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 3:00pm MST	I'm gonna have to drive that same distance eventually anyway
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 3:00pm MST	Yoire gonna drive half an hour to tell him to stop being a butthole?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 2:52pm MST	Scott is just being a butt hole and I feel like I need to go home and tell him to quit being a butt hole.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 2:51pm MST	:(
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 2:50pm MST	I might have to go home afterwards...
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 2:35pm MST	Told you so. Dr. Mcevoy hates us.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 2:26pm MST	On another note, what are we doing?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 2:26pm MST	Ah, yeah that's weird. I guess we'll be seeing Dr. Tischler a lot more.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 2:25pm MST	Dr Tischler confirmed what Olivia said about Dr McEvoy in the email we just got.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 2:18pm MST	What?

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 6:16pm MST	This is not including drinks, and you can't see 5lbs of steak or 3lbs of hamburger meat.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 5:57pm MST	I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation. I'll take a pic when I get it all unpacked
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 5:56pm MST	Food is never an issue with me
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 5:49pm MST	Guys I bought way too much food. None of you guys can eat breakfast before you come. And you can't leave until it's mostly gone.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 3:18pm MST	I think I have fries at home but I don't really wanna turn on the oven lol its so hot

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 3:03pm MST	You're probably right. So nobody wants anything?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 2:38pm MST	The amount of cottage cheese I've eaten would disgust you.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	Pizza is pretty much the only acceptable place for cheese.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	What about in pizza?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	That's pretty wrong in my book.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	It's gross.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	Yeah.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 2:26pm MST	Had cheese wronged you?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 2:25pm MST	Because I'm a terrible person, obviously
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 2:25pm MST	Alright well I'm going to the store for real now, does anyone want anything?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 2:25pm MST	Why do you hate cheese, Olivia?

Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 12:34pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 12:02pm MST	So I'm about to go shopping for food, last chance for requests. Also, Scott and I don't really eat sliced cheese, so if you guys want cheese on your burgers either someone can bring some they already have in their fridge, or I'll buy some today but someone has to take the rest home with them.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 9:01pm MST	Holy shit you're right. On the browser they're massive
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 8:51pm MST	It's an illusion man
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 8:43pm MST	Ia it just me or are these watermelons smaller?

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 2:13pm MST	I knew it, he hates us. Guess we'll just have to play cards against humanity and watch independence day.
Jose Celaya	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 2:12pm MST	Hey guys, I don't hate you. Looks like I can't shoot anything.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 1:54pm MST	When we drunk bowling, I'll get some of the peers there to review my melons
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 1:47pm MST	Yeah well last I checked, your melons aren't peer-reviewed.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 1:47pm MST	My melons are all the data I need
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 1:39pm MST	I'm gonna need you to compile your data into a poster
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 1:37pm MST	Outside of the chat, people are all over my melons
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 1:35pm MST	I don't believe you, so far I'm the only one in this chat to compliment your melons.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 1:34pm MST	Thanks. Guys tell me I have great melons
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 1:34pm MST	Those are some nice melons.

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 1:08pm MST	I think he hates us.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 12:09pm MST	Oh well. Did jose ever ask his parents or does he just hate us?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 12:05pm MST	I feel like that won't work all that well...I know they have some at the rec but I don't think I can get in during the summer..
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 12:04pm MST	The main library has some but theyre the weird ones where you put your hand in

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 8:45pm MST	It's life changing
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 8:43pm MST	That sounds amazing.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 8:36pm MST	I'm listening to my records and I decided you guys have to listen to dueling banjos.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 8:35pm MST	It's my Democratic duty
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 8:34pm MST	Thank you emanuel for voting.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 8:33pm MST	I say one
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 8:03pm MST	Option 1: Skip shooting so jose can come and we can still go up the mountain and do whatever. Option 2: Go shooting at 11, then pick up jose while Scott gets the grill going (it'll take some time to get the coals lit and everything anyways) Option 3: We do the barbecue one day and go shooting the other. Option 4: A different idea from one of you guys
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 8:00pm MST	So the way I see it, we have a few options.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 8:00pm MST	It's doable, I just wanna make sure everyone is cool with that.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:59pm MST	Ok so the area that we go shooting is open, but the rocks and shit have shifted quite a bit since we last went. Basically it's kinda tricky to hike down to the ravine when you're carrying a bunch of guns and ammo and watermelons
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 6:53pm MST	Scott and I are going to run up the mountain real quick and see what it looks like, I'll let you know
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 6:38pm MST	No, yeah I can't go up with you guys if you're going to shoot, it's my dad, I definitely want to go. Sorry guys
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 6:38pm MST	Plus Scott and I haven't driven up there to see if it's open or not, sometimes it's closed because the fire risk is too high, so we don't even know for sure yet if we can
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 6:35pm MST	What if I don't let you touch any firearms?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 6:31pm MST	Haha, it's just that I apparently can't go shooting, cause I have parents ...
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 6:30pm MST	I knew it. Guys he still hates us...
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 6:23pm MST	Whaaaaat
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 6:15pm MST	Hey guys, looks like I won't be able to make it on Sunday
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 2:44pm MST	I just did the verbal and quantitative parts of practice test 2 in the book, scored 162 verbal and 167 quantitative
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 2:42pm MST	I'm confused
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 2:28pm MST	I hope you guys are ready to buy me dinner...
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 6:53am MST	But...why did you fill it out twice, with different responses???
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 11:38pm MST	I am. I filled out the form and everything.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 11:19pm MST	That's good cause the revolution is starting on Sunday at 1 (most likely anyway, if emanuel is available)
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 11:05pm MST	I can start a revolution with those
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 9:50pm MST	Do you think we have enough firearms for everybody?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 8:39pm MST	Lol I haven't checked since earlier. I'll check it right now, proud of you jose
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 8:39pm MST	Also do you guys have like girlfriends that wanna come? Like emanuel if you wanna bring your girlfriend you can
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 8:39pm MST	I filled it out!
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 8:38pm MST	Just waiting for him and jose to fill out the damn survey.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 8:26pm MST	Just let me know what day works best so I can give everyone a ride there
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 8:18pm MST	Awesome. I'm cleaning my guns for you guys and everything.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 8:12pm MST	I talked to my parents and I am good for the barbeque. I'll fill out the survey when I get home.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 7:41pm MST	So we should all be good to go shooting on the mountain, as long as daniel is down for it.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 3:29pm MST	LOL me too emanuel
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 3:28pm MST	Or I've really been fucking up lately
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 3:28pm MST	Same here. We don't have time sheets.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 3:28pm MST	That's what I thought, ok awesome, thanks
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 3:27pm MST	Uhhhh I never fill out time sheets. I just get a stipend for the whole summer...
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 3:26pm MST	Hey guys, we don't have to do time sheets right? My mentor and I got an email, but I think that's for UBRP
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 2:12pm MST	There were those worksheets, I did one of them
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 2:04pm MST	Was there anything specific we needed to do for tutoring today?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 1:30pm MST	Well now I'm definitely not inviting Yeezy...
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 1:28pm MST	Oh yeah. It's in China Olivia
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 1:27pm MST	I thought we were taking it in China
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 1:27pm MST	Lol definitely doing that now.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 1:26pm MST	Cool, thank you!!!
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 1:26pm MST	Please don't steal my identity or egg my parents house
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 1:25pm MST	Can one of you check your confirmation email? I wanna make sure it's the right one...
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 1:22pm MST	Want it at 1?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 1:20pm MST	If was the afternoon, don't exactly remember. But there's only two choices, morning or afternoon
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 1:19pm MST	Hey when you guys registered for the gre, was the time 1:30 - 6:00 pm?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 12:25pm MST	Where are you?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 12:24pm MST	I cannot find this room
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 12:14pm MST	Smh
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 12:11pm MST	Better hurry. Imma eat all your food
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 12:08pm MST	Oh Jesus I forgot
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 12:06pm MST	Emmanuel are you alive?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 11:02pm MST	Me too
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:56pm MST	I'm fine with Thursday
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:56pm MST	I think Thursday worked fine lol
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:39pm MST	My Internet is so bad. I keep thinking you guys are dead but then I'll get like 3 messages at the same time but out of order
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:37pm MST	Perfect lol
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:32pm MST	Lol every 15 minutes sound good? Haha
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:32pm MST	Please don't have every possible hour in it like Paul's group
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:31pm MST	Any day works for me really. Maybe someone should just make a doodle poll already
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:31pm MST	How about Wednesday then?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:30pm MST	At least this Tuesday we do
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:29pm MST	To study? We still have tutoring..
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:28pm MST	I've done so much gre practice, except for the writing part. I'm in the top 500 on my app
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:28pm MST	How about Tuesday?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:27pm MST	Oh yeah, speaking of that, i can't make it tomorrow, Mondays don't really work for me
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:27pm MST	Ruhroh
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:26pm MST	I still have not done all of the GRE stuff for this week
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:23pm MST	Oh ok well I feel less terrible then. Cause I know I'm still not doing shit in my lab because I don't have all my training.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:22pm MST	It's by 5 pm
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:20pm MST	I'm assuming it's by the end of the day.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:20pm MST	Are you guys working on it tomorrow then giving it to your mentor like during the day or 1st thing in the morning?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:15pm MST	I always said I had a good amount but I realized I was writing an abstract instead, so I just started it too haha
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:12pm MST	I still need to work on mine.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:11pm MST	I have no idea...I guess we'll find out. Did you guys finish your intros? I started mine like an hour ago lol
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:10pm MST	Lol
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:08pm MST	Anyways, will his absence affect your presentation?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:08pm MST	Oops wrong chat Lol
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:07pm MST	Si soy!!!
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:05pm MST	Psh yeah or just so you don't actually have to talk in front of the class. But our group literally only met once last Wednesday after class, we just did the PowerPoint on Google docs
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:04pm MST	Nope. We're doing a PowerPoint presentation with a crossword puzzle that the class has to do as we lecture.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:03pm MST	We did for that special reason haha just seemed like the safest way to go
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:03pm MST	No....
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:03pm MST	Recording / video of some kind
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:03pm MST	A recording????
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:02pm MST	You guys didn't do a recording?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:59pm MST	So one of our group mates from mhd just texted us saying he's sick and can't present with us tomorrow...
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:57pm MST	It's cool.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:36pm MST	But I trust you guys to be responsible, otherwise I wouldn't be inviting you over. Still though, Scott and I could potentially get in a lot of trouble, so we're just trying to cover our asses.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:21pm MST	Plus I though jose drives too? But if he really is 17 like his profile says then he's definitely not drinking at my place unfortunately Ûæ∞õ
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:20pm MST	Lol I'm happy to try it sometime, just not at my place, which is really Scott's dad's place, and I just don't wanna cause him any problems.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	1. I vote King's Cup be the exception to the drinking games rule; dont hate it till you try it 2. The keys message should have just been directed at me, considering I am the only other member of this chat with car keys to surrender 3. I dont think any of us will drink too much if its an actual food event
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:15pm MST	Basically I don't want us grown ups to be liable for anything. Y'all gotta behave yourselves at least until you leave my bbq and go to a real party.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:14pm MST	I'll leave my kegs at home then
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:14pm MST	And if you're driving, you surrender your keys until Scott or I say you're good to drive.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:13pm MST	Lol alright here's what's up. If you're 18+ and want to have a beer or 2, fine. But there's not gonna be any beer pong, no tequila shots, none of those crazy drinking games you kids play.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:07pm MST	I have the same question.... I play by Mexican rules at parties, as I made very evident on the survey, which is 18+ for alcohol
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:06pm MST	Will this be a BYPRD(bring your own red dirt) party. Also, will you refuse to serve me alcohol unless I put 21+ on the survey?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 8:59pm MST	It's more of a brown unfortunately...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 8:59pm MST	Now that's the real question
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 8:59pm MST	Do you have red dirt?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 8:45pm MST	I mean I do have tiki torches...but I don't know about red carpet...I have some dirt?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 8:44pm MST	Does that mean the red carpet and Tiki torches are a yes?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 6:32pm MST	Lol nvm Paul responded to my survey. I'm not sure if I can get Yeezy to come...
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 6:27pm MST	These motherfuckers
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 6:27pm MST	Cool thanks for the heads up. Unlike all these other people...
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 6:03pm MST	Olivia, I'm a maybe for the barbeque. My dad's birthday is on July 2nd and my mom's is on July 4th, so I may or may be in Phoenix on Sunday. I'll let you know when I know though.
Jose Celaya	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 9:42am MST	5 sounds good
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 9:19am MST	That works for me
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 9:05am MST	Ok, at 5? Does that work for everybody?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 9:02am MST	Let's meet Monday
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 8:46am MST	You guys are cray cray. Did you figure out a new time to have our study group?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 8:36am MST	Do not underestimate our dedication to Lindy's
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 8:34am MST	You are not at Lindys. Nobody goes to Lindys at 830 in the morning.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 8:33am MST	If you don't wanna register with us, you can just tell us.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 8:32am MST	No we're at Lindy's
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 8:28am MST	I appreciate that emanuel. Are you guys still in ILC?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 8:28am MST	I think Olivia is the one that hates us
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 8:27am MST	We will pray for you
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 8:24am MST	Lol yeah I forgot to tell you guys, I didn't get my voucher number so I have to register next week..
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 8:17am MST	Are you alive Olivia?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 23, 2016 at 2:40pm MST	Well we'll all be together tomorrow morning so we can just figure it out then. I just didn't want Marisa or daniel to show up and none of us be there
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 23, 2016 at 2:34pm MST	As I sent it I realized that I can't make it tomorrow
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 23, 2016 at 2:34pm MST	I just sent it.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 23, 2016 at 2:29pm MST	Sweet cause I'm going home. Can you let daniel and Marissa know, like maybe shoot them an email
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 23, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	I'll down to reschedule
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 23, 2016 at 2:00pm MST	Plus I'm already done for the day in my lab....anyone?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 23, 2016 at 1:49pm MST	Do you guys just wanna reschedule for tomorrow? Since neither Paul or jose can go? Or still meet?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 23, 2016 at 1:49pm MST	I knew it. He hates us.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 23, 2016 at 1:30pm MST	Hey guys, I won't be able to make it today :-(
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 22, 2016 at 3:21pm MST	Third floor by the elevator
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, June 22, 2016 at 3:21pm MST	So where are yall at?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 22, 2016 at 2:57pm MST	Ok. I kno2 where the cafeteria is if that's where you are
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, June 22, 2016 at 2:56pm MST	Jose is going to get you
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 22, 2016 at 2:56pm MST	Could you be more specific
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 22, 2016 at 2:56pm MST	Were here

Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, June 22, 2016 at 12:58pm MST	I'm getting food right now. I'm gonna he hanging out here though until the meeting.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, June 22, 2016 at 12:44pm MST	How early?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, June 22, 2016 at 12:43pm MST	Sounds good!
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 22, 2016 at 12:41pm MST	Not sure what time I'll be done but if I can scoot out early I'll let you know
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, June 22, 2016 at 12:40pm MST	I'm gonna go early to the medical center to eat lunch at the cafeteria if anyone wants to join.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 19, 2016 at 11:18pm MST	Hahahah bedtime.... Ok g-night!
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 19, 2016 at 11:18pm MST	I'll see you guys in the morning it's way past my bed time
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 19, 2016 at 11:17pm MST	I agree
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 19, 2016 at 11:16pm MST	I sent him a friend request and he never accepted, so I guess he secretly hates us
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 19, 2016 at 9:00pm MST	I would add him, but I don't have him on Facebook
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 19, 2016 at 8:54pm MST	Okay now I just need to add Jose
