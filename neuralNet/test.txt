Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 3:10pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	Ok, maybe my email will remind her to send yours too.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	Cindy said she was gonna send me one this week, haven't gotten it yet
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	Also, what was the deal with MARC letters?
Jose Celaya	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 3:08pm MST	Can confirm, here now
Daniel Osorio	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:57pm MST	I think today is the last one
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:44pm MST	No.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:44pm MST	I'm really hoping someone says no
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:22pm MST	*good
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:21pm MST	No most of them just want official scores and transcripts upon matriculation so you're goos
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:07pm MST	Who wants to spend 27$ for them to email a copy of my scores on their bullshit test
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:06pm MST	I think it'll be fine. If they're willing to reject someone who's super qualified because you didn't wanna throw away $10 for no good reason I say fuck them
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:05pm MST	I only applied to it because my PI said I should apply to fancier schools in california and they gave me a fee waiver
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:01pm MST	Cause that defeats the whole purpose
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:01pm MST	Pretty much
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:00pm MST	All I know is official transcripts are like $10 each or something and I am not about that kind of life
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:49pm MST	The only application I've seen so far that requires official transcripts is UCSF, the rest will take unofficial until you get accepted.
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:46pm MST	I was supposed to put unofficial ones in my applications right, then I send the official ones through uaccess?
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:46pm MST	Can someone explain how the whole sending official transcrips thing works?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:18pm MST	Si

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 8, 2017 at 7:53am MST	Not sure. You might want to consult Google. Calamine is more for itchiness, aloe is more for soothing, like a burn.

Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:02pm MST	A few weeks. The doctor prescribed some cream and Prednisone
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:02pm MST	And are you applying any sort of cream?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:01pm MST	A few parts are leaky. Mostly it's tender, burning, and itchy.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 4:59pm MST	Benadryl would make it not itchy, but it wouldn't affect how painful it is. Is it like open and bleeding? Or dry and itchy? I'm gonna need some more input
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 4:58pm MST	I don't know. I've been taking so much Benadryl.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 4:55pm MST	It looks so much like shingles.

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 2:14pm MST	No computational biology for me.

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 3:31pm MST	I don't understand what is your right thing
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 3:30pm MST	It's on the right side of my ribcage, my right thing, and on the right side of my belly button. I think it's a mixture of sweating more and being in a humid ass place.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:05pm MST	Lol

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:00pm MST	But you'll get a paper
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 1:59pm MST	I miss cactuses though
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 1:59pm MST	Still at least you have time
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 8:20am MST	Aw damn, I forgot about that. Well, I'm actually not gonna be in town til the 11th. At the beginning of the summer I wasn't sure if I would get into this conference in Columbus but I did. So I'm gone an extra week.

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:46pm MST	And say it all the time and when she agrees you'll get really pretty satisfaction out of it.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:46pm MST	You should just make a codeword for retarded in your head

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:38pm MST	How offensive is the word retarded on a scale of 1-10. Where 1 is not at all and 10 is like the same as a racial slur or something to offend gay people

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 10, 2017 at 4:47am MST	That is the male orangutan, trying to make the best of his circumstances, approximately 15 minutes before his girlfriend started having her baby. I guess the inspirational aspect that I take away is try to enjoy your shitty life, because at any moment, it could get way shittier.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 9, 2017 at 6:58pm MST	But that's prime orangatan labor viewing time
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 9, 2017 at 6:17pm MST	I never knew you had a favorite primate
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 9, 2017 at 6:15pm MST	Also, disclaimer, orangutans are my #1 favorite primate, and probably like in the top 3 favorite animal.

Jose Celaya	Monday, June 26, 2017 at 5:51am MST	You were making breakfast, but stopped all of a sudden, that's why your keycard and wallet are out like that. You stopped because you heard a noise, you see the aloe...and you remember. Someone from your past said they'd make contact again, and that they would point aloe in the direction they were going next. You run out to find them, in such a hurry you don't even put on your shoes.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 26, 2017 at 4:56am MST	Hey do you guys know that game where I show you like three random pictures and you have to make up a story explaining how they some sort of logical sense? @Emanuel I feel like you'd be good at this game

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 6:20pm MST	I was saying you guys should peer pressure me into spending an excessive amount of money to buy Scott a plane ticket to Philly for 4th of July. Then Emanuel called me some weird in Spanish
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 5:48pm MST	You can always just make that
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 5:47pm MST	Cause I need my bagel and coffee.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 5:44pm MST	Potatoes, rice, chicken. Those are all pretty cheap. Beef is okay if it's on special. Eggs are also good.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 5:41pm MST	Don't eat out is an easy one.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:32pm MST	And I got extra summer money because of Marc and Penn.

Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:18pm MST	What does Scott regularly do with his spare time?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:17pm MST	And he hates his roommate.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:17pm MST	He doesn't like it?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:15pm MST	It's such a good fucking word
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:14pm MST	Lol I figured what does it mean?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 4:08pm MST	I think I've almost convinced Scott to come here for 4th of July.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 3:09pm MST	Everybody from Philly dope af

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:40am MST	Oh shit. When are you gonna start climbing rocks outside
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:38am MST	It's okay. I'm appreciating vicariously through you
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:37am MST	That's very nice. My dream is to live somewhere where I can walk to get groceries

Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:30am MST	This is the beginning of my uprise a fashion designer. I suggested she wear the flower
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:28am MST	That reminds me. I also saw a horse drawn carriage yesterday in Old Town
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:26am MST	Y'all are terrible at uploading pics capturing your day to day lives.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 7:25am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 1:12pm MST	Yeah I was thinking about the Tupac movie. I can't wait for spider man
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 11:28am MST	That's what I do though
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 11:26am MST	Guys a cottage cheese container is less than two dollars here
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 9:56am MST	Ikr. I'm sure she gets real swole
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 9:53am MST	That's silly
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 9:51am MST	One of my roommates does her makeup before she goes to the gym
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 9:46am MST	I have yet to go to the gym since I've been here....I'm the worst
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 9:45am MST	It's peppermint. I'm gonna go to the gym and get extra sweaty so that I can get good use out of it
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 9:42am MST	We don't have an old town but we have a college town
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 8:00am MST	Well I'll pray for your journey
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:59am MST	It's not actually old most of it's new or at least relatively new since this whole place is old. But they have a lot of cool gift shops so I'm just gonna go wander around
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:58am MST	Where you going?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:57am MST	I'm waiting for the bus...I waited for like 15 minutes before some dude told me the route was detoured so now I'm waiting at another stop
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:54am MST	Here it was 5.99
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:53am MST	Oh ok they have early bird showings in Tucson too. I think here early bird is like 7.25 or something
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:49am MST	And the ticket was less than in Tucson
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:48am MST	Unfortunately
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:21am MST	Olivia do you have epic Saturday plans?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:21am MST	I decided on the weekends humor will suffice. I'll save inspiration for week days.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 7:20am MST	Lol very true.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 16, 2017 at 7:08am MST	Shits true though.

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 6:30pm MST	Indoor rock wall
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 5:41pm MST	That's dope
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 1:10pm MST	Olivia using a split screen is one of the major steps to achieving your true form
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 9:40am MST	Holy shit this is the spiciest orange chicken I've ever had
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 8:15am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 7:01am MST	My favorite so far
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 7:01am MST	Oh shit
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 6:03am MST	You listen to random access memories?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 15, 2017 at 6:03am MST	Daft punk is the shit
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	I mean it really doesn't even feel that hot except when you stand directly in the sun. It just feels sticky and disgusting and gross and uncomfortable
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 2:23pm MST	Yeah I've never appreciated the indoors and AC more in my life
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 2:18pm MST	Jesus Christ it's like 50% humidity here. Fortunately it's only like 82 but it feels so disgusting...
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 11:27am MST	Now you can buy 10 crockpots and flaunt your wealth
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 8:14pm MST	üçâ
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:35pm MST	which are correct
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:32pm MST	I got an email telling me about it.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:12pm MST	I think they open at like 9
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 7:11pm MST	How do I check if I have the same problem as Olivia?
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 6:02pm MST	I don't think so, I think I haven't received my stipend because I just signed up for direct deposit like two months ago
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 4:03pm MST	Porqu√©?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	Those mother UKs better have your money
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:45pm MST	Oh jeez. Someone cursed you guys
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:41pm MST	Yep that sounds like you
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:40pm MST	Oh they fucking know. I never let them forget it.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:40pm MST	You should have brought your DVD collection with you. Now how is anyone gonna know you're an adult?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	It's $3 there too
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	*but it's

Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 3:24pm MST	Haha I love that movie
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 2:38pm MST	Down
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 2:36pm MST	So is philly huge?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 2:36pm MST	Yeah there's the subway which is a train but underground. And the trolleys use the same rails as the subways so they're also underground. And then the L is the above ground local train, but I haven't ridden that yet, then there's Amtrak that goes to the suburbs and to NY and DC and whatnot.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 1:31pm MST	Just like the cat tran
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 13, 2017 at 5:25am MST	Emanuel you didn't have to give me that much!
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 9:26pm MST	@Olivia Gorushi you need to get venmo so that I can pay you for the barbeque
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:34pm MST	Ok im just curious because it shows that the money went to my bursar's account on 6/6/17 but it's still not in my bank account
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:17pm MST	Oh, I was the only one around I thought you meant me
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:16pm MST	Right? Like WTF? If you go on your uaccess, click account inquiry, then click activity. Do you see a deposit?
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:15pm MST	And Olivia are you kidding?
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:15pm MST	*updated us on your life
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:14pm MST	Hey Daniel
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:14pm MST	So imagine my grumpiness at that point
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:13pm MST	And I actually like you. I don't like them.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:13pm MST	These girls don't know shit
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:13pm MST	Cause you know what's good for you.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:12pm MST	Yeah...Or when it gets to be about 8 weeks into the program and I'm busy grinding trying to get shit done before deadlines
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:11pm MST	When you've collected enough Olivia candies to evolve?
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	Both scenarios sound hilarious
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	But I'm not yet that strong
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	The strongest people tell other people to get out of their goddamn apartment.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:09pm MST	Fuck
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:09pm MST	But that means I can sleep more
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:09pm MST	Although im going to go in to my lab late tomorrow like 9 or 9:30
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:07pm MST	Just demand brownies
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:06pm MST	That wasn't even the scariest part. Here's more pictures of that though
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:06pm MST	You've even got comments now
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:03pm MST	It's even better
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:02pm MST	My blog is updated with some pictures from a crazy tream building thing we did
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:01pm MST	Do you wanna do VR in grad school now?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:00pm MST	The guy across the hall have two Oculus rifts. I've played a decent amount there.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:59pm MST	Have you tried out a bunch of gear though?
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:59pm MST	Holy shit. Is it like a big room?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:59pm MST	*node is
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:58pm MST	I don't know what a nice is, but it's‚Äã powered by 48 nodes
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:14pm MST	The math department is pretty small. It's in the science building on half of the second floor
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:11pm MST	First day was pretty good. I've got some stuff to do already, and I got a pretty cool desk. But humidity is fucking retarded.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 1:15pm MST	Why don't we have upside down animals in the library?
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 11:55am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 11:55am MST	&quot;People say not to bite off more than you can chew, but I'd rather choke on success than nibble on mediocrity&quot;
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 11:54am MST	What's that quote?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 11:54am MST	You'll die rich af like Elon Musk.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 11:54am MST	Elon Musk is crazy
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 11:54am MST	I'd probably die
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 7:04am MST	I have a partner though
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 7:03am MST	I am awake as fuck
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:44pm MST	I'm gonna have all the sleeps. Buenos noches.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:44pm MST	Sounds good. Have a good sleep
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:42pm MST	Which is probably a bad thing to inhale
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:42pm MST	My guess is it is mold though
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:42pm MST	I'm basically a microbiologist now
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:42pm MST	Ok well when you take your sample make sure you go somewhere where the odor is strong. Like you walk in the room and smell it right away.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	I mean it's just that I don't really pay attention to it
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	I do
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	But again you don't have any kind of control. How do you not know what normal garbage smells like
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:40pm MST	Yeah but you won't be able to convey any useful information to me either. It'll be too qualitative.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:40pm MST	I meant in the name of science
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	Do it in the name of garbage
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	I'll let you know how our trash smells
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	Um yeah there's not a good system in place for smellovision.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	I also wish there was a way for you to convey the smell to me
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:38pm MST	Haha, that's cool. I wonder what they'll say
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:38pm MST	Microbiologists love disgusting questions like this
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:37pm MST	I mean it's still humid inside places. It's not like the humidity stays outside.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:36pm MST	Maybe the bags are different?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:33pm MST	I mean, I'll notice if it smells weird
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:32pm MST	Hm, I guess I've never really noticed the specific smell. I'll see how trash smells here
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:31pm MST	Idk. Like whenever I go to take out trash in Tucson like whether its my dumpster at home or when I used to take out the trash at the stores I worked at, the dumpsters all have the same smell.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:56pm MST	It's kinda like chipotle but much spicier which is an improvement
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:15pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:09pm MST	I guess I'll shop tomorrow
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:06pm MST	I'll ask them about that
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:05pm MST	I assume
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:05pm MST	Ok. I'm gonna get you through this Jose. I highly recommend you get your roommate to go with you though, so you guys dont end up buying duplicates of shit like my dumbass roommates did
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:04pm MST	Plates and silverware?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:03pm MST	But I've been with my mom tons of times

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:59pm MST	Alright but only because they don't charge extra for guac.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:59pm MST	No I literally live in the green box lol everywhere around here is super safe. My first night here I walked to the pizza place and had pizza and a beer at like midnight and it was perfectly not sketchy
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:59pm MST	Eh I'd do it. Honestly I'm already slightly homesick, Mexican food might remind you of Tucson. Heck it might be good
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:58pm MST	I'd go there
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:58pm MST	Pictures look good
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:54pm MST	The answer is yes
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:54pm MST	Their logo has a neon light shaped like a saguaro....Idk....
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:54pm MST	Am I brave enough to try the Mexican place by my dorm?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:53pm MST	Haha oh my god
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:53pm MST	I guess now we'll be inspired
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:53pm MST	It's ok
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:52pm MST	It wasn't a good photo Jose. I'm sorry
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:51pm MST	I'll try to take her advice
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:51pm MST	In fact...
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:51pm MST	She is Jose. That's why I picked her.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:49pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:49pm MST	4/5
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:49pm MST	Hold on I gotta catch this Poliwag first
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	So yeah I'll find some people
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	We meet everyone tomorrow
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	And the other one I didn't talk to much
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:47pm MST	He takes it Saturday
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:46pm MST	I met my roommates
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:46pm MST	Yeah. I just took half doses, it worked for me alright. I get to my lab around 8-8:15 so let me know if you want a courtesy call
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:43pm MST	It'll be ok I guess
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	Are you on ETS too?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	Crazy bastards
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	It's because it's summer too. In the winter it'll set at like 4pm. Hence why these crazy folks have daily savings time.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:41pm MST	You will I'm sure. Jesus. It sets at 8:30 here.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:41pm MST	That's the weirdest thing I've heard
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:41pm MST	The sun sets at 9:15
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:40pm MST	That's because it is lol
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:40pm MST	I'd feel like I was in the 1800s
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	Like if you go to tombstone that shit is everywhere but that's because it's touristy.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	I don't know sounds cool
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	People in big urban areas have never seen a horse in their whole lives.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	I've seen them in Seattle too but nowhere else.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	Why don't we have these in Tucson?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	Lol yeah I saw a carriage ride earlier.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:19pm MST	Because Jose. I am here to work. I am here at an ivy league school, among the top 3.7% of applicants. I can get wasted at home whenever I feel like it. If and when I decide I want to get crunk, I will do so quietly in my room, probably with a bottle of bourbon while I read publications and maybe watch Grey's anatomy.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:16pm MST	Is it as lit as this one?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:08pm MST	I'm pretty excited. I wanna fast forward to tomorrow when we have our first meeting and figure out how everything's gonna be.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:07pm MST	Are you excited?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 1:43pm MST	I have a desk
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 1:43pm MST	It's not bad, it's a good sized room
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 1:43pm MST	I'm probably gonna have to go get food
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 12:03pm MST	I'm in Indianapolis as fuck
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 9:18am MST	Is it lit tho
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:58am MST	What time is it there?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:56am MST	That's tragic
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:55am MST	Because I keep thinking it's just gonna be one more day, before I can go shopping for realsies...
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:50am MST	Why don't you have any money?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:49am MST	Those sneaky motherfuckers
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:49am MST	Yeah. I didn't realize, but half the plate is eggs under the pancakes. Or hot cakes as they're called here.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:48am MST	That looks delicious
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:42am MST	That's late breakfast
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:41am MST	Yes but not this time Olivia
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:00pm MST	Goof night my children
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:00pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:00pm MST	That shouldn't have been separate
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:00pm MST	I most definitely
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:59pm MST	Word. Just hit up the group chat when you're bored af at the airport.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:58pm MST	Thanks for the prayers. My parents are all stressing out, so they'll serve as my alarm clock.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:57pm MST	You will also receive my prayers
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:56pm MST	It's true. It's late af here, so I'm going to bed now. @Jose will pray for your pilgrimage to Indiana. I'm 3 hours ahead of y'all, would you like a courtesy text?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:54pm MST	I'm gonna have so many fucking skills
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:52pm MST	That's cool. You should talk to him
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:41pm MST	That would be civil engineers then. They do bridges, dams, infrastructure kinda things. But it's really more of a glorified trade. Very few engineers get graduate degrees. Most get a bachelor's to learn like the math, physics, materials, etc behind whatever they're building, then go directly into industry or government after they graduate
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:38pm MST	Um ok that's a little vague lol because thats what most engineers do. What kind of stuff? Like bridges? Airplanes? Lasers? Powerplants?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:32pm MST	I'd be fucking stoked to go here. This city is fucking awesome.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:20pm MST	For grad school?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:20pm MST	So I don't know about other programs, but y'all should ask if they offer early admissions.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:19pm MST	Lol I typed that before you said I'm smart.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:19pm MST	Olivia you're smart
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:17pm MST	Guess how many applications there were
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:06pm MST	Oh yeah. I don't know about the whole program but almost everyone is 20-21
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:03pm MST	It's true. I would kill to even have little Olivia and big Olivia as roommates.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:01pm MST	I am. But I don't like any of them enough to adopt them like I did you guys.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:00pm MST	You're too mature for them
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:57pm MST	We've been playing board games and dancing and shit
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:57pm MST	Y'all are nasty
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:38pm MST	Lol well that's what's up here apparently.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:16pm MST	At least we're both introverts
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:08pm MST	@Jose Celaya are you there as fuck?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:39am MST	They start check ins 24 hours before your flight. The order you check in is the order you board the plane, and there's no assigned seating. So if you check in early you'll get an aisle seat or a window seat. If you check in late you get stuck in a middle seat.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:38am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:38am MST	Yep. Download the app. Check in.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:37am MST	No
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:34am MST	Or run out of gas
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:33am MST	Oh shit. Don't be late or lose your boarding pass.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:48am MST	Oh ok then it should be fine then. Relax Jose Cindy will take care of shit
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:18am MST	Wanna know something annoying for me? Apparently my record according to Cindy says I graduated in May. But I never applied for graduation, I haven't finished the requirements for my majors, and on uaccess it says I'm not graduated.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:03am MST	Jose are you excited???!
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:08am MST	I've actually avoided eating eggs cause I don't want to leave my roommates without eggs.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:03am MST	Your blog is exactly as I imagined it, minus the catalog of eggs eaten daily
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:01am MST	Organized as fuck. I wish I had a blog but that shit is way too fancy for my life.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 5:53am MST	https://projects.vrac.iastate.edu/REU2017/interns/emanuel-bustamante/
Jose Celaya	Friday, June 9, 2017 at 10:58am MST	You guys just can't comprehend my wisdom
Jose Celaya	Friday, June 9, 2017 at 10:57am MST	Oh my god Emanuel
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 7, 2017 at 2:29pm MST	Ok, hopefully I can easily navigate the black markets
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 7, 2017 at 2:28pm MST	Well at least you're over 21, I'm stuck with restaurants and hookah lounges
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 7, 2017 at 2:27pm MST	Yeah. All the bars downtown have happy hour every Wednesday. $5 mixed drinks $4 wine $3 beer and I think 1/2 priced appetizers from 5-7

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 7, 2017 at 2:23pm MST	Yeah...
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 7, 2017 at 2:22pm MST	I don't get a food check
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 7, 2017 at 2:22pm MST	Did you get your food check?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 7, 2017 at 2:20pm MST	That's crazy, we'll pray for you though

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 7, 2017 at 2:11pm MST	Ok, almost home

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 7, 2017 at 2:10pm MST	@Jose or @Paul maybe??? I'm still trying to figure out why I don't have my money yey

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:41am MST	Lol idk they all say 2 minutes away. My guess is they work just like a bus driving up and down frequently travelled areas and just pick people up and let people off as needed?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:40am MST	You won't care
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:40am MST	But I mean you're drunk
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:40am MST	It probably takes more time to pick you up, since it's picking up other people near you

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 27, 2017 at 8:06am MST	I'm pretty sure it used to be gold but it's just super faded.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 27, 2017 at 8:06am MST	#nevertan #suicideprevention
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 27, 2017 at 8:05am MST	Thanks you Emanuel
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 27, 2017 at 8:04am MST	Wow, I thought it was obviously grey, I have to reevaluate my life
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 27, 2017 at 8:03am MST	I can live with tan.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 27, 2017 at 7:59am MST	What's the thing Scott's dad says?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 27, 2017 at 7:58am MST	Ok good. I mean you're kind of stuck with us so yeah....I also gotta let Scotts dad know you're coming over I haven't done that yet.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 27, 2017 at 7:58am MST	I'm down.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 27, 2017 at 7:57am MST	Whoa there Emanuel calm down. You down to help us get shit ready?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 27, 2017 at 7:55am MST	So some of our friends can only come in the afternoon, others not until later, so I'm just saying people can come over anytime after 12, and y'all can stay an hour or the whole day if you want.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 27, 2017 at 7:52am MST	But I figured it was the nice neighborly thing to do since they're new to Tucson. Neither of them have been more than a few miles from campus
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 27, 2017 at 7:51am MST	Lol the most danger y'all will be in is from your reckless driving. One of the girls is named Caroline, she's an undergraduate from a small liberal arts college in Minnesota, she's working in my lab this summer. The other girl is her roommate, and I haven't met her yet.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, May 26, 2017 at 8:34pm MST	Are you lit?

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 26, 2017 at 3:13pm MST	Lmao it will probably be some time in the afternoon. We're driving to wickenburg in the morning, staying for a few hours then coming back to Phoenix. I can text you as we get places so you have a better idea.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, May 26, 2017 at 2:20pm MST	@Olivia Gorushi when should I be ready by?
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 26, 2017 at 12:59pm MST	Ok, but I'm gonna say I told you so if it turns out to have murderous intentions
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 26, 2017 at 12:57pm MST	No I went in through the garage so I wouldn't scare it off. It's just trying to get out of the sun for a bit
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 26, 2017 at 12:56pm MST	You can do anything you set your mind to
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 9:19pm MST	I need to send more messages so it scrolls off the screen.

Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 8:51pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 8:46pm MST	The 50 cent song?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 6:30pm MST	You're goddamn right
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 6:30pm MST	It's not sarcastic

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 5:57pm MST	*knowledge
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 5:57pm MST	No cause me and Emanuel are friends, I don't have to speak formally to him
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 5:43pm MST	Alright. You should probably sleep at Jose's the night before and have him take you. Cause you're supposed to get there like at least 90 minutes early. And it's an hour drive from my place lol
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 5:19pm MST	What time is your flight Emanuel
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:31pm MST	If you have documentation proving you're black or pacific islander or asian, I'll consider it
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:30pm MST	You should consider judging me the content of my character rather than the color of my skin
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:29pm MST	Wow. The racism just got real
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:27pm MST	Holy shit me too.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:26pm MST	But babies are the future

Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:26pm MST	Babysitting then
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:25pm MST	You should take up a side job dog sitting. Then you could have a lot of dogs at your house without being responsible for them forever
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:24pm MST	More than I thought I would lol the house is just super empty
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:23pm MST	Yeah, this is his second week.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:23pm MST	Did he already leave?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:21pm MST	Yeah, Scott literally forgot he told his mom we would meet her in wickenburg. He planned it like weeks ago, never mentioned it to me, and remembered today
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:20pm MST	This is why we need doddle polls
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 6:58pm MST	So the BBQ is being moved to Sunday, apparently Scott and I are driving out to buttfuck nowhere to have lunch with his mom. Does Sunday work for y'all?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 4:47pm MST	üçâ
Daniel Osorio	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 12:18pm MST	Are you going to apply?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 11:58am MST	Daniel you should apply for that Princeton molecular biology program Cindy just sent us
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:40am MST	I'll bring a case of redbull
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:24am MST	@Paul and @Emanuel come to the BBQ
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:21am MST	I thinking we'll start having people over around noon, and grill throughout the day as needed, and people can hang out for an hour or all day if they want.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, May 23, 2017 at 10:16am MST	So...

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 9:55pm MST	Ok well we haven't set a time yet, so maybe we'll still be hanging out when you get back in town
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 9:54pm MST	I don't have the slightest idea. It's part of the program
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 1:36pm MST	@Paul I know you're busy with your fancy summer program but can you make an appearance???

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 12:44pm MST	Lmao that's hilarious
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 12:43pm MST	Rumor has it that if you leave gum out, they'll eat the gum and it'll clog up their digestive systems
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 12:42pm MST	The baskets are gorgeous, baby cakes little üçå is doing well. They ate the daffodils and snoops ate one of the bushes. The stuff along the fence is still growing, but they keep eating the flowers off the plant so nothing blooms.

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:34pm MST	I don't wanna use poisosnllns or snap traps because and snoops gets into the garden...
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:31pm MST	Yup. We haven't had any packrats in the garden for a couple days now. But the moles are digging straight up into the garden, so they're not even encountering the repellant, I poured the repellant around the garden as a perimeter to keep stuff out.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:27pm MST	They tried taking the tomato plant...But it wouldn't fit down the hole. Part of it is still there, maybe it'll recover, idk. They already took the cucumber and canteloupe plants. The only intact plant in the back plot is the water melons üò≠
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:25pm MST	What else did they take?

Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:05pm MST	Yep
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:04am MST	I don't care as long as I eat it out of a ramen bowl.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:31am MST	I could probably do today if you can't, I still gotta finish analysis though

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:53pm MST	As long as it stops, I don't give a fuck
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:51pm MST	This is gonna sound gross, but for every sinus infection I've had, there's only one possible outcome. You get mostly better, like your fever goes away and you stop feeling like shit but you're still hella congested on one side.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:48pm MST	Alright. And you're still at least somewhat congested, at least on one side?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:46pm MST	Yes
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:39pm MST	Hmmm it sounds like sinuses, not an ear infection. Ears don't really have a direct connection between each other cause of you know your brain in the way.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:32pm MST	No I've never had that. Does it hurt like inside your ear like where your finger can reach or like deeper like where your temple is?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 10:08am MST	I know. I think it might be moles though, not packrats. They dug up from underground...
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 9:58am MST	Yup...
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 9:13am MST	@Emanuel Bustamante once again I have some good news and some bad news.

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 8:50pm MST	I remember there were so many new fonts we had never seen before.

Jose Celaya	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:56am MST	But that would be racist
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:56am MST	Wow. You know if you were a bunch of white guys being dicks to the one new brown guy in the group, calling him different J names like juan, Jos√©, julio, etc that would be pretty shitty
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, January 31, 2017 at 9:52am MST	James, not Colbert

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 9:00pm MST	Oh shit idk. Like just regular guys or boyfriends or Scott or what?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 8:36pm MST	Olivia, what's the most annoying thing that guys do?

Jose Celaya	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 6:58pm MST	It's a deep hatred
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 6:56pm MST	Jose you will hate me
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:36pm MST	I day invite him. Worst case scenario, he's a douche and no one talks to him so he stops looking at the chat
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:32pm MST	I don't have a strong opinion about this.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:21pm MST	Pic for pic
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:19pm MST	Looks like one
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:18pm MST	Is he a douche though?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:15pm MST	He refuses to let us invite him to a group chat
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:15pm MST	It sounds like Paul doesn't see any reason to open his heart
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:14pm MST	And I hate his hair
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, January 30, 2017 at 5:10pm MST	Fuck that guy

Jose Celaya	Sunday, January 29, 2017 at 10:46pm MST	I don't know
Jose Celaya	Sunday, January 29, 2017 at 10:46pm MST	I was thinking: Research in Dr. Timothy Secomb's Lab
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, January 29, 2017 at 10:46pm MST	I havent made mine yet
Jose Celaya	Sunday, January 29, 2017 at 10:45pm MST	Anyone awake?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, January 29, 2017 at 8:39pm MST	Im just locking her outside until she decides shes done throwing up and eating her own vomit
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, January 29, 2017 at 7:33pm MST	You're supposed to be the officionado on drinks

Jose Celaya	Sunday, January 29, 2017 at 6:05pm MST	And Emanuel, for now, at ease
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, January 29, 2017 at 6:04pm MST	Also, just as an update from a previous conversation, USB type c is out. It's charges my phone super fast and transfers data way faster too
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, January 29, 2017 at 6:04pm MST	Awaiting orders, Captian.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, January 29, 2017 at 5:57pm MST	And i feel like im way more committed to this conversation than you are, based on our relative levels of excitement at the prospect of you getting laid.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, January 29, 2017 at 5:46pm MST	This is true
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, January 29, 2017 at 5:46pm MST	But jose did you just fucking say &quot;That would be ideal&quot;
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, January 29, 2017 at 5:46pm MST	So im working in my lab right now, so I can only check my phone every few minutes

Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, January 29, 2017 at 5:32pm MST	Lol
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, January 29, 2017 at 4:34pm MST	Im so over summer apps
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, January 29, 2017 at 3:37pm MST	I'll pray for your continued success

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:29am MST	Yeah but in book of eli the cannibals had these really bad tremors. Thats how you knew how to stay away from them
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:24am MST	Where he translated the Bible or some shit?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:23am MST	Then a subset of the girls could feed everyone
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:23am MST	Just knock up countably infinitely many girls
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:20am MST	Well I guess that's logical
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:20am MST	Yes.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:20am MST	So we're saying in a world where humans can only eat humans, it's ok too eat humans because they themselves have eaten human?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:18am MST	Lol how does it not make sense?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:17am MST	I'm just saying lion kin don't make no sense
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:17am MST	I would was a dead human, but I'd rather die than kill an innocent human for food
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:17am MST	I'd start knocking girls up and making cottage cheese
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:16am MST	He just said thats the only thing I could eat are people
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:15am MST	No dairy?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:14am MST	If thats all I could eat, then thats what I would have to eat.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:13am MST	What would you do if all you could eat were humans?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:11am MST	You cant just assume the gazelles and shit spoke, you never saw them speak.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:10am MST	If Ramon and pumba could speak
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 10:10am MST	It's Sunday?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:49am MST	Lol what??
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:45am MST	Haha, unfortunately a lot, for starters I'm always late
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:44am MST	Nothing. What's a motto with you?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:42am MST	What is a motto?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, January 28, 2017 at 9:36am MST	We have to write up the solutions to this week's homework. Don't worry, we're not there by choice
Daniel Osorio	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 7:33pm MST	same, everyone had to because the spots themselves have no dye and aren't visible under UV light
Daniel Osorio	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 7:28pm MST	the spots weren't really yellow but they were visible
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 7:22pm MST	Lol well did your TLC plate work?
Daniel Osorio	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 7:16pm MST	yeah

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:33pm MST	Hey do you guys know that march for science thats happening in march
Jose Celaya	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:23pm MST	I bet captain america could sell the shit out of crack
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:21pm MST	You're
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:21pm MST	It's OK. Your gonna be a doctor
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:20pm MST	Youre life is bullshit and im so jealous.

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 6:20pm MST	Goddammit emanuel
Jose Celaya	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 11:22am MST	Did you throw up a little bit?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 11:09am MST	I'd also exchange the shit out of it.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:38am MST	I lost faith in the note lol but I definitely need a new phone now because the screen on my other one stopped working
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:24am MST	I bought the Moto Z droid from Verizon ,but I just now realized that this is the iPhone of androids. It has no headphone jack so it needs a converter and the charger uses a USB type c instead of micro USB like all other androids. The pros is that it's really fast, great camera , and it has a fingerprint scanner. Also I can buy mods for it to make it into a projector or a phone with 22 hr extra battery life. Should I keep it or exchange it ?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, January 27, 2017 at 10:20am MST	Guys I need your opinion
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 8:08pm MST	Dont you love us emanuel

Jose Celaya	Thursday, January 19, 2017 at 12:15pm MST	But that's against lab safety protocols
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, January 19, 2017 at 12:12pm MST	Beards require maintenance though

Jose Celaya	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:11pm MST	It usually loops back
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:11pm MST	It just repeat like that por que it no se mi vida
Jose Celaya	Monday, January 2, 2017 at 10:10pm MST	No se me ha acusado a los estudiantes organizados por la ma√±ana de ayer y me dice la gente

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:47pm MST	Maybe we should start in South tucson first or like a food city.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:47pm MST	That way it's educational
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:43pm MST	It's hard describing stuff in Spanish without knowing how to spell things.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:42pm MST	It sounds like aye-ya-yii but not like that celito Lindo song.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:42pm MST	Ijole
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:41pm MST	But with more feeling

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:25pm MST	Well it probably works for dance majors right?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:15pm MST	My personal statement is actually just a link to a video of me dancing.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:13pm MST	Lol I saw a meme the other day that reminded me of you
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 6:12pm MST	I'll take personal responsibility for your eulogy and express my grief the only way I know how: dance.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:56pm MST	So I just got up to shut my lab door because this shit is way too creepy. I kept looking over my shoulder cause I thought I heard footsteps.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:55pm MST	That's the most coordinated pair shrug I've ever seen.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:36pm MST	Like what
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:25pm MST	Mostly just feed the cells and finish some western blots, at least for today. It's weird being here right now, like I'm used to the lab being empty but I'm pretty sure I'm the only person on the entire floor
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:23pm MST	And then I was really lazy and didn't wanna come in until almost 4 so that's why I'm here so late
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:22pm MST	Cause everyone else is out of town, so I get to take care of the lab all by myself.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:20pm MST	Why?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:14pm MST	Lol well obviously not you
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 2:48pm MST	Anyone else stuck going to their lab today?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	üòÇ

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 3:24pm MST	Like my PI wrote the grading criteria with me. It was based on attendance, keeping a lab notebook, attention to detail, and writing a 200-400 word abstract. Like it was all super specific.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 3:22pm MST	None of which she ever mentioned to me
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 3:20pm MST	Dude what? Did she give you a reason?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 3:19pm MST	My stupid PI is giving me an incomplete for my lab credits
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 3:00pm MST	Yeah that seems too reasonable.

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 12, 2016 at 9:02am MST	That panda is fucking creepy
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 12, 2016 at 9:01am MST	I'm the panda. And that guys desk is gonna be my final.
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 12, 2016 at 8:57am MST	That's the spirit
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, December 10, 2016 at 6:27pm MST	That robotics tournament was too long
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 10, 2016 at 12:33pm MST	Those motherfucking physics people
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 10, 2016 at 12:28pm MST	Guys I just remembered my physics final is Thursday night :(
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 10, 2016 at 9:13am MST	I can make room in my back seat

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, December 9, 2016 at 3:50pm MST	Did we just become homework buddies?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, December 9, 2016 at 3:44pm MST	*semester
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, December 9, 2016 at 3:35pm MST	Guys I'm not happy with my academic performance this semester

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, December 9, 2016 at 8:20am MST	Anyone know if there is a print station somewhere at umc?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 9:55pm MST	So are we all down to do breakfast Saturday morning? Would someone be able to pick up daniel and/or emanuel?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 9:47pm MST	That would make more sense.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 9:43pm MST	It probably fit in with the conversation
Jose Celaya	Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 9:41pm MST	What?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 9:41pm MST	What
Jose Celaya	Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 9:41pm MST	Positive for...f word

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 9:10am MST	I didn't wrap it though...
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 9:08am MST	What Paul said
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 7:05pm MST	Please
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:41pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:38pm MST	That's why I vote up bad reviews from her book on Amazon.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:18pm MST	Also how long is your performance?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:17pm MST	You want me to fight your pi?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:15pm MST	You have to present? Like in your lab?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:11pm MST	Are they at least giving you next week off (
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:06pm MST	I asked for more time off of the lab to do homework and it's turned into a series of meetings about why I'm not ready for a PhD
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 3:59pm MST	Did you get a fleshlight?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 3:54pm MST	Also, I'm officially a dope ass Santa claus
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 1:56pm MST	I saw you jose
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 1:43pm MST	Also I really really have to pee and I can't stop burping
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 1:39pm MST	Now I have to walk
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 1:37pm MST	Raise your hand and answer every question
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:48am MST	We'll eat together in spirit
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:47am MST	I just realized I wrote PSU
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:47am MST	Dude you said PSU
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:47am MST	Omg you guys are hilarious.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:43am MST	Be there in 1 min
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:42am MST	She did it to herself
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:19am MST	That's the struggle
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:13am MST	I don't have time I gotta go buy my secret Santa present
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:33am MST	I would try to talk to the professor personally
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:31am MST	Tell him I'll fight her if he wants me to. Just take her to my ballet recital and I'll fight her after.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:30am MST	Ok know I'm late
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:20am MST	Yeah, I told him he should just turn in both, since he already told his professor in advance. But mostly he's freaked out because he thinks he's going to have to confront her or something.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:18am MST	Only he rewrote the entire assignment so he could still turn it in.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:16am MST	It's not Scott's fault his teacher doesn't check his emails
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:14am MST	Scott emailed the professor and said he was concerned his partner was plagiarizing, attached the two files, and asked the professor to check turnitin.com or another plagiarism detecting software, because he didn't want to be responsible for plagiarism.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:12am MST	Scott looked at the first project, it also had huge blocks of text copy and pasted without any citations or quotes.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:11am MST	Except her writing was weird as fuck. Scott googled the first paragraph, and the very first result was a patent, which she copy and pasted verbatim without any kind of citation.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:09am MST	You guys I need your input on yet another dilemma
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 3:02pm MST	Why motherfucker?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 3:02pm MST	That motherfucker
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 3:01pm MST	Oh, I emailed Daniel. He said he can make it to the recital.
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 3:00pm MST	I was just there, I have tutoring, I'm going back at 4 though.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 12:32pm MST	I might come by idk yet
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 12:24pm MST	For a while.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 12:19pm MST	I'm gonna go to PSU still
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:52am MST	Is that a building?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:52am MST	Wtf is that
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:42am MST	I'm more used to the first one as well
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:42am MST	Oh ok. Well I was originally saying the first one but everyone else complained when I said it
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:41am MST	There are two types of secret Santa. The total secret where we all put our gifts in one location then we open them without ever knowing who got them for us, or the exchange where we just give it to the person on the day we choose
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:32am MST	Ugh you guys I don't wanna think about presenting
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:22am MST	Lol emanuel has to go by himself. Emanuel you should talk for the entire 50 minutes.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:21am MST	Cindy is playing match maker with you two
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:33pm MST	Cindy wouldn't want me reading that
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:21pm MST	BTW if you ever want to read about someone who has seen and done some shot, read ODB's wiki page, specifically the section about &quot;legal troubles&quot;
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:20pm MST	Old dirty bastard, yes, ok good so we're not that old.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:19pm MST	Dirty old bastard
Jose Celaya	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	Doesn't he have a clan?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	Related: are y'all familiar with the Wu Tang?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:16pm MST	Not gonna lie. 9/10 questions I ask you guys is strictly because Scott and I are out of the loop from a hip thing, or we're trying to gauge how old we are.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:15pm MST	No idea
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:14pm MST	Hey real quick what does tyt stand for?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:13pm MST	I meet with her on Tuesday. I'll talk to her about it then.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:06pm MST	Are you just bored with your specific project or the lab in general?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 1:40pm MST	So you wanna find another lab?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 1:35pm MST	I think my PI thinks I'm dumb and that I have issues understanding stuff about the lab. Thats true sometimes, but for the most part, I think the shits boring so I don't really care about really understanding it. I understand it enough to get by.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 1:28pm MST	Guys I have a dilemma
Jose Celaya	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 8:48am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 6:12pm MST	Maybe it's just really bad allergies and I will be all better tomorrow.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 3:33pm MST	Lol I think we should exchange them Wednesday like before or after emanuel's recital.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 3:32pm MST	Mostly me
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 3:32pm MST	*uncoordinated
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 3:32pm MST	Guys we're so fucking incoordinated
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 9:50am MST	Yeah. Here in town I like anywhere that has cheap, good drinks and the music isn't too loud. I usually go to shelter, Che's, plush (but they recently changed name and management so idk if they're still good), pockets, and salty dawgs II. Those are usually my go-to places depending on what side of town I'm on
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 9:48am MST	It's not that big of a deal cuz I've been to dozens of bars in europe and Mexico before haha
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 9:37am MST	I'm not big on birthday celebrations
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 9:29am MST	Are you doing anything fun today?

Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 8:26am MST	Happy birthday!
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 12:58pm MST	I'm waiting for my omelette
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 12:42pm MST	Fuck her
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 12:42pm MST	No. I just got into a long meeting with my PI.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 12:17pm MST	Emanuel did you decide you hate us
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 11:43am MST	Yeah, a bday party isn't worth 1500 in red tag fees
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 11:20am MST	Paul, are you still doing something for your birthday this saturday?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 11:17am MST	Same table as yesterday

Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:09am MST	Yeah, give me the email again
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:07am MST	Show that he's smart and a minority and wants to go to grad school and wants to do research
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:01am MST	I'd say be honest in the essay questions, show that he's really excited about research. And talk about at least a couple of specific applications he's thought of that he's interested in pursuing. I think I still have my application if he wants to look at it.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, November 28, 2016 at 3:13pm MST	See you in class Olivia

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 19, 2016 at 11:55am MST	Then I have no idea.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, September 19, 2016 at 11:12am MST	8 is true. Genes are distributed between the strands. And for 9 I'm guessing it's the 2nd one, because it looks about 10 steps/turn aka 10 bases/turn but count them to make sure cause I can barely see in the pic.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, September 18, 2016 at 2:00pm MST	No response

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 10:58am MST	Two questions can be a total of 12, but they don't have to be 6 individually. One could be 10 and the other could be 2
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 10:41am MST	Why does each question have to be worth 6?

Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 8:01pm MST	In retrospect it does seem dumb that we specify that we're in MARC to the people who are coming for the sole purpose of assessing MARC.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 7:54pm MST	Idk. I don't have any of them fancy scholarship thingamabobs like you kids.

Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 2:21pm MST	And so is my mentor. We've been busy as shit so he hasn't been able to review it. I'm just gonna send it to tischler like that. Fuck him
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 2:20pm MST	Don't you guys already have it done, like from the summer
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	Friday

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 7:34pm MST	But I'm in california...
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 7:29pm MST	We never drink bowled either. There's so many things we were gonna do drunk that we never did.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 7:29pm MST	Lets do it
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 7:24pm MST	I agree with Emanuel
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 6:21pm MST	I think then only me and Paul can have em them. Possibly Jose. We don't know if he's a binge drinker, an alcoholic, or both yet.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 6:18pm MST	If you've been drinking, you're probably around drunk people, and drunk people are crazy, so you need two sawed off shotguns for your own safety.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 6:16pm MST	Not after I've been drinking, no.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 6:10pm MST	I woulda used one of your guns
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 1:15pm MST	You need to move before you're devoured by weird animals
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, September 3, 2016 at 1:13pm MST	Fuck that thing
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, September 2, 2016 at 11:49am MST	RIP Olivia

Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 2, 2016 at 8:57am MST	Hey Daniel my mom is going to Magdalena today
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 1, 2016 at 2:29pm MST	Hey anyone around?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 2:47pm MST	It's fucking terrible. Your brain basically explodes
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 2:46pm MST	Guys I found out how you die from drinking too much water
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 12:33pm MST	Do you have the app? Can you catch another one that's close?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 12:31pm MST	Milk was a bad choice
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 12:03pm MST	It's so fucking hot outside
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 31, 2016 at 11:42am MST	It's for you, my dead homie
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 30, 2016 at 9:35pm MST	That seems like such a waste.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 30, 2016 at 8:16pm MST	It's ok. This is my life now. I expect these things to happen fairly regularly now that my life has gone to shit.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, August 30, 2016 at 6:33pm MST	Get it together original Olivia
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 30, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	I can't. I have to tutor in ten minutes.

Jose Celaya	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:21pm MST	I was thinking downstairs. But yeah upstairs has bigger tables.
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	It should be even better now. Wanna meet there?
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	I'm like 5 mins from there in math. When I went at 1 there were a few spots.

Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 1:18pm MST	We're gonna have to start selling drugs.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:26pm MST	I don't understand. I'm eating dinner at the small mill?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:24pm MST	I'm trying to bridge this cultural gap
Daniel Osorio	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:19pm MST	Cindy said getting the check by mail would take longer, but I guess it didn't
Daniel Osorio	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:10pm MST	hey guys, I got my stipend by mail today maybe you can check if its in your mailbox
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:05pm MST	What's a molinito?

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 9:08am MST	I still have nothing.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 9:38pm MST	Ûæì¥
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 6:20pm MST	It's not a flaw, that's how you say it. Jos√© is going to have to accept when his future wife is right God dammit.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 3:09pm MST	True, you have to be more accepting of your wife's flaws
Jose Celaya	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 2:50pm MST	Yeah that's Olivia
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 2:49pm MST	ÛæÅî
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 1:45pm MST	That gif is beautiful
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 1:37pm MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:16am MST	I think it's the stipend slowing things down
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:03am MST	Guys where the fuck is our money? I'm so broke....
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 9:35am MST	I can see that. Is your new health insurance going to cover your orthodontist?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 9:19am MST	All I want to do is switch a class so I can make it to my orthodontist appointments. This school is discriminating against adults with braces.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 9:14am MST	It is ass for me as well
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 3:38pm MST	Seriously though, we only have two weekdays till school starts. Where is the money??
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 2:17pm MST	I'd have to see to agree. From my observational powers, most people with laptops at the Scented Leaf are actually just here to talk.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:40pm MST	*financial aid office
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:18pm MST	Have your financial aids disbursed yet?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 7:05pm MST	RIP your battery. I am not in Phoenix.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:51pm MST	Yeah I heard you guys went to the zoo, didn't even invite me. Hey none of you guys are in Phoenix right now are you?
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	Them too
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	At first glance I thought you said Asians
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:43pm MST	Automatic
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:42pm MST	How many doll hairs did you pay?
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:42pm MST	This is true
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:41pm MST	What the fuck jose got a car??
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 8:59am MST	How did you get in?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 8:57am MST	The classroom is insulated work recycled jeans
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 8:51am MST	Just got here
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 7:14pm MST	That's pretty lit.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 6:34pm MST	I had a whole 6.5 drinks, which is exactly half of what Jos√© requires to get drunk, supposedly.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 5:37pm MST	Sounds like it was 2 turnt
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 2:31pm MST	Lots of alcohol and pretty good music
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 10:41am MST	How was your shot filled night?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 10:38am MST	Me too fam me too
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 12:13am MST	Me too
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 12:03am MST	It's a watermelon man
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:33pm MST	I'm doing shots of cafe patron followed by shots of half and half. It's magical.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:32pm MST	It won't load....I'm so sad
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:17pm MST	Probably Big Sean if it's the one I think
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:17pm MST	Do you guys know who it's by?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:16pm MST	It goes &quot;I ain't fuckin wit chuuuuu&quot;
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:16pm MST	Hey guys I'm at the bar and there's a song on
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 11:32am MST	I have to, I barely got sober from the past 48 hours
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 11:31am MST	Wow, go ahead and rub it in why don't you
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 11:31am MST	Physics is so easy though...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 11:29am MST	I thought you needed a different one though?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 11:29am MST	You're my hero.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 7:55pm MST	Alright. Thanks.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 7:50pm MST	Yup.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 7:50pm MST	Oh, you wanna know how long you need to run it.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 5:07pm MST	Also, Paul could you email me the pdf of that physics book pretty please?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 4:53pm MST	You could compare it to one you do know, use the integral or ratio tests etc
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 4:39pm MST	Enlighten me
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 4:05pm MST	I do
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 2:59pm MST	I'm sure she'd tell you the perfect number of avocados to put in guacamole in return
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 7:55pm MST	I can can personally vouge for her grandma. She does not support eugenics.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 7:50pm MST	Marisa will accept you
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 7:31pm MST	I agree
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 7:31pm MST	You're so fucking weird Jos√© lol

Jose Celaya	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 11:22am MST	D√≥nde est√°n?
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:38am MST	Yep. I'll be heading to campus in about 20 mins. Just tell me where you guys are then
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:33am MST	The stomach wants what the stomach wants
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:32am MST	Are you at least still there?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:25am MST	You could say that
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 9:21am MST	Kk
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 8:58am MST	On the way to my lab to pass the final gauntlet
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:27pm MST	Also I say cactus grill. Boston market is delicious but makes me incredibly tired
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:20pm MST	I also think we should get drunk.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	Boston market or cactus grill
Jose Celaya	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:06pm MST	Who's the traitor?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:06pm MST	Are we all going to eat lunch together before the poster session, like the last supper?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:06pm MST	I think 4 by 8, so 2 posters for side by side but don't quote me.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 8:43pm MST	What time are you guys heading to campus?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 8:04pm MST	They never specified, but my uncle said same as the grad school thing, business casual
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 8:03pm MST	What's the dress for tomorrow?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 9:16pm MST	Then you have to go to www.google.com and search for download ram. Just torrent the file. You might have to unzip it first.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 6:04pm MST	Like an Internet pirate that knows how to download stuff and reflect things in powerpoint.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 5:14pm MST	Got it!
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 4:57pm MST	If that makes sense?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 4:57pm MST	But move it across to the other side
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 4:57pm MST	I think you just click and hold the image in the corner like when you resize it
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 6:48pm MST	We need to show everyone so they know they need to stop making Arthur memes.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 12:16pm MST	Don't leave me behind!
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 12:16pm MST	*coming
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 12:10pm MST	You guys hate me! You're going to cactus grill without me Ûæçç
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:57am MST	Cactus grill forever
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:55am MST	I might be able to make it. My mentor is actually in my lab for the first time in over a week so I can't really duck out right this second...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:40am MST	Also there's a farmers market outside of my lab
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:32am MST	Lol alright. I'll leave in like ten minutes then.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:25am MST	That's exactly what happened. My soul left my body yesterday
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:04am MST	^this happened
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 9:02pm MST	I'm not sure. I thought of life alerts. Someone else needs to think of the equivalent
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 8:14pm MST	Guys, I see we all pitch in for Olivia's life alert and the 17 year old equivalent for jose
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:48pm MST	Don't get my hopes up
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:41pm MST	It was the worst thing that's happened to me pretty much all week.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 2:49pm MST	Ugh that's the worst.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 2:48pm MST	She said the figures themselves are all fine but the whole poster needs to be revisited with the question in mind
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 2:46pm MST	What about your nice straight lines did they like those?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 2:28pm MST	Sent
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 1:39pm MST	emanuelb@email.arizona.edu
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 1:38pm MST	Apparently my email doesn't remember you guys, I need an address
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 1:37pm MST	Ok hold on
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 6:46am MST	I did. It's required for ABRCMS, otherwise I wouldn't have included it because it makes it look so wordy
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 9:16pm MST	Guys I'm so dumb. I just sent my poster to tischler because my mentor is finally content with it, so I sent an email asking tischler if he could review it, and I forgot to attach it
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:20pm MST	Yeah I figured it would at least help some of you a little
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:19pm MST	Well that's good. I appreciate that. My Pell grant runs out this year and I'm already like 20k in school debt :(
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:16pm MST	Roger that
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:15pm MST	Affirmative
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:10pm MST	I'm packing up and then I'm gonna head over
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:46pm MST	The Mentor?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:42pm MST	Emanuel, will you ever return to the 3 pokestops? ... Do you despise us?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:32pm MST	Marissa and OliviaTwo are missing out not being in this group char
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:28pm MST	lol
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:26pm MST	I may have lost that...

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:34pm MST	It's not relevant now, but that doors open, and it's too funny to pass up
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:28pm MST	Maybe you need a fecal transplant
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:23pm MST	I would be like physically ill.

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:21pm MST	It's the best. I get so many sleeps.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:21pm MST	Do you like having a bedtime?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:18pm MST	I have a bedtime every night. And pokemon go has been drastically interfering with that.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:15pm MST	Olivia you have a bedtime on Saturday?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 8:17pm MST	Also, keep me updated on the number of people haha

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 6:01pm MST	Paul, do I have permission to invite people to your party if I maintain the 2:1 ratio?
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 5:17pm MST	My mentor sent me a revised version at 5:01 ü§ò
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 5:03pm MST	I'd say probably not
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 4:59pm MST	My mentor read mine but my PI didnt
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:51pm MST	Is that the same girl?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:15pm MST	...
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:12pm MST	But you know who is?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:12pm MST	We'd be drunk, so we wouldnt complain

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 2:13pm MST	That's what im using. But it seems like it would be weird considering its gonna be an entry with just our picture and just our name
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 1:53pm MST	Lol not that I know of. He is gonna give me feedback on my poster though.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 1:51pm MST	* to say that

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 1:47pm MST	Nope, I took them out. I looked at the abstracts from 2nd year marc students and they didn't have any in theirs.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 1:44pm MST	Did you have in text citations?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 1:43pm MST	That's what I put.

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:07am MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:05am MST	Well excuse us. Not all of us got perfect 170s on the quantitative GRE. Some of us can't even count to 12.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:03am MST	So I asked Dr. Tischler for feedback, and he said he would submit as is, so I guess you don't need references.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 8:03am MST	Jos√© don't be late today
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, July 31, 2016 at 1:08pm MST	I'll pray for you ‚òù

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 4:34pm MST	If anyone *cough* PINKY PROMISE *cough* would like to go pokemon hunting tonight Scott and I are going later, haven't decided where yet
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 11:12pm MST	http://brobible.com/life/article/pennsylvania-town-devastated-dunkin-donuts/
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 7:01pm MST	It's my way of saying if yall ever want a fake tattoo, I know a girl haha
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 6:59pm MST	Is this your way of avoiding telling us you're not going to hunt pokemon with us ever?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 6:57pm MST	She also does henna though
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 6:53pm MST	Ahhhhh ok I was gonna say henna is like a dark red/brown
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 6:49pm MST	That doesn't look like henna
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	I don't understand...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 6:44pm MST	It's cuz I'm not even out of lab yet...
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 4:46pm MST	The pinky has lost its meaning
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 3:58pm MST	It's like pinky promises don't mean anything anymore...smh
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 3:53pm MST	Don't expect me to make a Google survey for every event.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 3:53pm MST	Where tf is that?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 3:53pm MST	It's not like I sent you a Facebook invite or anything

Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 10:38pm MST	Uhhh tomorrow?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 7:59pm MST	I appreciate that Paul. I think emanuel was just happy the storm sabotaged me so he could have a chance to catch up to me level.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 7:07pm MST	Power restored, crisis averted.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 7:06pm MST	Because it is.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:34pm MST	Also no cooler. No food. We're gonna have to drink all the beer before it gets warm
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:33pm MST	I appreciate your concern Jos√©. According to Scott, one time the power was out for 5 days
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:32pm MST	And pretty soon I won't be able to text, because I just have my battery and my backup battery.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:31pm MST	Olivia, I literally thought it was something bad
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:31pm MST	I can't work on my paper cause I can't charge my laptop
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:30pm MST	Well guys I don't know if you can read this but it was nice knowing you.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, July 26, 2016 at 12:29pm MST	Cindy said she'd email us info about it
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 26, 2016 at 12:29pm MST	Are you having MARC print it?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 9:36pm MST	Pinky promise??????
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 4:17pm MST	I don't know. You guys are the Pok√©mon shamans
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 3:56pm MST	So Paul is coming pokemon hunting too then???
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 3:15pm MST	Psh Jos√© won't come with us, if he hates us too much to go pokemon hunting, then he definitely hates us too much to go to Seattle
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 3:14pm MST	When we go to Seattle
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 3:12pm MST	If we ever go to Seattle though...
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 3:11pm MST	Does that mean what I think it does?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 3:11pm MST	Paul, did you say we?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 3:09pm MST	Is jose coming? Did you tell your parents 10:30?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 2:47pm MST	I second that

Jose Celaya	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 11:32am MST	So I can access it anywhere, doesn't take up space on my computer and I don't have to worry about installing the and setting up anything
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 11:31am MST	Easier than on your machine. But if you do want to do it on your machine I'd say texMaker
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 11:31am MST	Why not do it offline?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 24, 2016 at 10:45am MST	It was the same Pok√©mon except they were all brown

Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:40pm MST	I think Jose will end up supporting her
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:34pm MST	When I met him for our meeting, we had to walk up a flight of stairs and I wasn't sure if he was gonna make it.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:28pm MST	I'm glad I don't live in Narnia
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:16pm MST	That's gross

Jose Celaya	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 4:20pm MST	We emailed back and forth 7 times. I sent a PDF since I didn't write it in word, and he asked me for the word copy. I had some of my methods in there, that troubled him, and my file was called UROC_2016_Paper and he took the time to remind me that it was a MARC specific assignment.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 4:18pm MST	Ruh roh
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 4:17pm MST	He sent an email to me and Sophia saying that our intros were due in less than an hour

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 10:31am MST	Actually he is a Pok√©mon. He evolves into drake.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 10:24am MST	I didn't know Lil Wayne was a pokemon trainer
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:32pm MST	I don't really feel an urge to do so...

Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 10:06pm MST	This would've been perfect
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 5:01pm MST	Me too.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 4:55pm MST	Illegal Pete's again? Or somewhere else on unversity?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 4:53pm MST	Hate us/GRE
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 10:50am MST	No way jose
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 10:37am MST	Emanuel where are you?

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 10:21am MST	Probably 5 for me, not sure though
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 10:20am MST	Yes
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 10:18am MST	This is a fun group message
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 10:06am MST	I just got out. Somewhere in the Union with AC
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 9:52am MST	Ok, probably somewhere with food.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 12, 2016 at 6:46am MST	No sorry but if you want I can listen to it after lab around 5
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 11:35pm MST	Probably the union
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 11:29pm MST	I needed to practice a presentation
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 4:43pm MST	ÛæÅî
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 2:58pm MST	There you go Olivia
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 12:31pm MST	If we make it, you're going to have to an apple phone so you play it
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 12:26pm MST	Lol thanks
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 12:10pm MST	You guys should start a FindMyMicrowave app
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 11:52am MST	Near the bathrooms, next to the pinkberry
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 11, 2016 at 7:20am MST	No but I brought my tablet so I can write directly on it. Scott disconnected the printer...
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 10:50pm MST	If only my printer had ink
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 10:41pm MST	Probably?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 10:34pm MST	Especially for 8am...
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	I don't know about that. I burnt my hand taking food out of the oven, so today is pretty much the worst day ever.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:11pm MST	Lol I'm not sure I'm qualified.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:09pm MST	Wow. Yeah people are dumb. You don't actually have to go inside anywhere to catch pokemon...
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:07pm MST	They just got kicked out for not buying anything.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:03pm MST	I almost ran over some people using that app because they crossed a light without the walk sign
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:01pm MST	Lol ambushed?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 9:00pm MST	I'm starting to dislike that app
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 1:32pm MST	CrossTrek
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 12:41pm MST	I don't think that was it...
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 12:41pm MST	Mini Cooper
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 10, 2016 at 11:08am MST	That would've been a good idea
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:38pm MST	Have a good time I presume
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:35pm MST	You guys still there?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:32pm MST	Greetings
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 9, 2016 at 10:32pm MST	Hi Jose

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 6:52pm MST	That thing is evil
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	I thought you would never ask.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 6:34pm MST	Ok I can do that
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 5:24pm MST	They underestimated peoples' love for Pok√©mon
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 4:43pm MST	Que?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 4:17pm MST	ÛæÅî
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 4:10pm MST	Because we are all beautiful. I'm down
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 3:26pm MST	I'm confused though, Holly just sent an email saying we have to be in ILC 150 on Monday at 8:30 but my calendar says were supposed to have more group photos at 8...
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 8, 2016 at 3:25pm MST	Maybe hunt for more pokemon if they fix the server.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:29pm MST	In so bored I started washing dishes and studying for the GRE
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:20pm MST	Yup.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:19pm MST	Oh hey I can see it now.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:18pm MST	It won't let me paste...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:16pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:12pm MST	ÛæÅî
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:11pm MST	Actually, I think I've gotten one of her messages twice before.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:09pm MST	Lol sorry?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:08pm MST	Not me.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 9:08pm MST	That's hilarious.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:56pm MST	....I'm just gonna stay inside and catch more pokemon tomorrow
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:54pm MST	Wha if we get you a sawed off?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:43pm MST	I don't think so
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:43pm MST	The mountain lions are Pokemon too
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:32pm MST	You turn on your location, then walk around and find poke balls and catch pokemon and go to gyms to fight and train and stuff.
Daniel Osorio	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:31pm MST	I've heard about it, is it like virtual reality or something like that?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 8:30pm MST	But have you SEEN pokemon go?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 7:44pm MST	Yeah that's a lot I've only ever seen snoops have like 1 in a day but I'm not home all day so who knows.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 7:29pm MST	And he's seizing a lot. Like today he had 3 episodes
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 6:00pm MST	Hey sorry guys my dog had another episode today but he's supposed to be cured by now, so I had to bring him to the vet Ûæ∞ï
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 5:35pm MST	Me too.

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 5:28pm MST	I'm down to study
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 5:26pm MST	I knew it he hates us
Jose Celaya	Thursday, July 7, 2016 at 5:24pm MST	I can't make it today guys, sorry
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:46pm MST	Shhhhhhhh
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:29pm MST	Don't say those letters...
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:28pm MST	I actually have a lot of fun doing it, but it's not very conducive to GRE studying
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:22pm MST	Because this is my life apparently
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:14pm MST	Are you wanting it again?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:11pm MST	It's so depressing. I watched it last night already
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:10pm MST	That sounds very depressing
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:05pm MST	Guys Hotel Rwanda is on. I'm pretty sure this is one of the most depressing movies ever made.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 9:05pm MST	?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:57pm MST	What word?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:53pm MST	Word.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:53pm MST	Exactly
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:51pm MST	That I can't do. I don't have one.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:48pm MST	You should probably bring it to our study group tomorrow
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:47pm MST	If that's weird, I don't wanna be normal
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:46pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:45pm MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:43pm MST	You don't hate us basically
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:43pm MST	Everyone's olivia until they say otherwise
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:33pm MST	I'm about to pull a Dr. Mcevoy
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:32pm MST	I would give full credit
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:31pm MST	Goddammit
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:31pm MST	(Olivia)
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:30pm MST	Oh and &quot;Marisa&quot;
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:28pm MST	It's a cute little dog eating a watermelon
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:22pm MST	Yeah but that's just because you don't have a PhD. Once you finish grad school you'll label all of your poop.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:15pm MST	That sucks though.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:58pm MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:54pm MST	Emanuel asks some good questions
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:44pm MST	Why?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:43pm MST	The other person. It was such a cluster fuck. I'm now convinced I made a horrible decision picking my mentor
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:40pm MST	So you protected yourself from poop?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:33pm MST	Chemicals mostly. But we also inventoried the freezer which is full of fecal samples
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:08pm MST	I figured out where an equation came from all on my own.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 7:06pm MST	Sciencing tired me out too much today
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 6:59pm MST	So I fell asleep too... In lab
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 4:47pm MST	I ate there for lunch. But my spirit it still there.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 4:24pm MST	Maybe we should wait til tomorrow
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 4:19pm MST	It doesn't look like they're gonna let me go anytime soon so I don't think I'll make it
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 2:25pm MST	Dr Tischler confirmed what Olivia said about Dr McEvoy in the email we just got.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 2:18pm MST	Olivia, your &quot;sources&quot; are the shit
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 6, 2016 at 8:33am MST	Why not what

Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 5, 2016 at 12:53pm MST	My first comment will be for the severe lack of reading skills
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 5, 2016 at 12:51pm MST	Maybe I will make a survery.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 5, 2016 at 12:48pm MST	If there was a post barbeque satisfaction survey, my first comment would be that there was a sever lack of red dirt.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 5, 2016 at 12:41pm MST	We forgot the red dirt...
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 5, 2016 at 12:25pm MST	I'm gonna feel really dumb if I bomb it.

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 6:16pm MST	This is not including drinks, and you can't see 5lbs of steak or 3lbs of hamburger meat.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 5:49pm MST	Guys I bought way too much food. None of you guys can eat breakfast before you come. And you can't leave until it's mostly gone.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 3:16pm MST	Uhhh French fries? Idk

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 12:09pm MST	Oh well. Did jose ever ask his parents or does he just hate us?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 12:04pm MST	I don't think there are any

Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	1. I vote King's Cup be the exception to the drinking games rule; dont hate it till you try it 2. The keys message should have just been directed at me, considering I am the only other member of this chat with car keys to surrender 3. I dont think any of us will drink too much if its an actual food event
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:13pm MST	Lol alright here's what's up. If you're 18+ and want to have a beer or 2, fine. But there's not gonna be any beer pong, no tequila shots, none of those crazy drinking games you kids play.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:07pm MST	I have the same question.... I play by Mexican rules at parties, as I made very evident on the survey, which is 18+ for alcohol
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 8:59pm MST	Do you have red dirt?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 8:44pm MST	Does that mean the red carpet and Tiki torches are a yes?
