Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	I'm semi over this whole application thing/haven't had enough coffee today/fuck this and I don't really feel making sure I did any of it right. If I did it wrong will they email me telling me to fix it you think or will they just not accept me?
Jake Croft	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 2:00pm MST	Wait so if I scanned my unofficial transcript for UCSF instead of the official one will they hate me and not accept me
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:59pm MST	Yeah I remember it being something stupid like that
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:59pm MST	That one is stupid though, they want you to scan your official transcript
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, November 27, 2017 at 1:48pm MST	Also yes, unofficial transcripts for applications. We can't upload official ones ourselves

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 10:14am MST	@Jose did you forget to send it to Jake you monster
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 9:38am MST	Then ask Cindy for a letter saying I need a letter for x y and z school.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 9:38am MST	So what I would do is go through all of your apps to to figure out what they require, some say it on their website, some say it on the last page of the app, etc
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 9:37am MST	However all of the apps are different. Some you just have to say you're in MARC and that's enough, some you have to upload a letter, some you have to fill out a form signed by tischler.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 9:36am MST	So Cindy should have a letter for all of us from Dr. Tischler just stating that we are in the MARC program, super generic not for any specific program
Jake Croft	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 9:34am MST	Wait so how do we do the fee waiver thing? Do we email them asking for one first and then have Cindy email them tje letter or do we talk to Cindy first?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 15, 2017 at 7:02am MST	@Emanuel what time do you have class today?
Jake Croft	Tuesday, November 14, 2017 at 8:48pm MST	Sorry that's an exaggeration

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:43pm MST	It means Scott was whining but he has conceded. Little Anthony's has passed the house.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:38pm MST	I feel like there must be a better way to facilitate democracy.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 10, 2017 at 5:36pm MST	I don't understand that reference.

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:07pm MST	He says he doesn't care, and him and I are carpooling. Too bad there's no tilted kilt anymore
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:06pm MST	That's also an option. Not much beer choice there though
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:01pm MST	I didn't know if we just wanted to go somewhere on University for the sake of convenience
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 9, 2017 at 3:00pm MST	üçâ

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:04pm MST	That's very true. You'd sound kinda silly if you were writing for a bunch of computer scientists
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:03pm MST	People who know how to code don't say that though.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 9:01pm MST	üçâ

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:59pm MST	I don't think that's a word
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:57pm MST	I wouldn't change anything. The people who're reading probably know R.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:55pm MST	Or just &quot;statistical analysis, or analysis of data from, ...&quot; etc
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:54pm MST	So I guess I should clarify what r is
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 8, 2017 at 8:54pm MST	)

Well you better hurry up&quot; and &quot;just say fuck your classes. You could get nothing but C's this semester and still get in wherever you want&quot;

Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:43pm MST	Yeah actually that's what it looks like
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:29pm MST	Example 4.4 helps
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:25pm MST	Let me take a look
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:24pm MST	Me neither. I looked at the equation but it doesn't make much sense to me
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 9:20pm MST	Did you get a look at 23?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:42pm MST	I was basing mine on that
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:38pm MST	That website makes sense to me
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:37pm MST	Yeah that's what I saw when I looked up the expansion
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:25pm MST	Yep, just change the 2i to 2i + 1 in the factorial and exponent
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:24pm MST	Yeah it makes sense. I'm trying to change the cos to sin right now
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:24pm MST	*were
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:21pm MST	And then terminates when the approximate error is less than the criteriom
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:20pm MST	Then the loop in the main function goes through each order
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:18pm MST	Yeah you have a (-1)^i term. You see it in the cos_app function?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 8:18pm MST	Jose one of the things I was confused about on 12 was how to do the alternating sign
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:58pm MST	Matlab right?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:57pm MST	Ok, well 4.15 should be easier than 4.12. I'll show you what I got for 12 and then I'm sure you'll be able to do 15
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:27pm MST	Wanna send me the code?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 6:27pm MST	I can't figure out how to do the while loop so that it adds each component after checking the approximate error
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 4:45pm MST	I sent you the book. I'm struggling with the last 3
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 4:35pm MST	It's all good, what's your email?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 4:17pm MST	Hey Paul, I'm sorry but my dad wants to meet for dinner, I won't be able to make it. If you email it to me though I'm sure I can fix it/ explain it pretty easy.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	6:30
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 3:37pm MST	MATLAB but it's basic math. As I need help with the setup

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 25, 2017 at 9:48am MST	*dungeon
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 25, 2017 at 9:48am MST	It's like a du dungeon
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 25, 2017 at 8:38am MST	So like if it's a Lugia, which is legendary, you need a group of like 12+ to team up and enter the raid together and fight it. If you guys beat it, everyone gets a ton of items and xp, but most importantly you're given like 5-12 premier balls to try to catch it. So it's currently the only way to catch legendaries in the game.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 25, 2017 at 8:36am MST	Basically they're team neutral bosses that pop up at gyms. Theres tiers 1-5, 1 being baby shit pokemon and 5 being legendaries. Tier 1 and 2 and a couple tier 3 bosses can be taken on solo, but anything bigger you need lots of people to team up and fight it
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 25, 2017 at 8:34am MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 25, 2017 at 7:54am MST	You're really dedicated to raids.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 25, 2017 at 7:50am MST	@Olivia what are raids in Pokemon Go?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 24, 2017 at 9:03pm MST	It's true. And he included the web address so they can look it up
Jose Celaya	Thursday, August 24, 2017 at 9:03pm MST	Well, you can't argue there. Brady is a CEO
Jose Celaya	Thursday, August 24, 2017 at 9:02pm MST	Haha, well I kinda feel bad, it seems like Brady really believes in everything he says
Jose Celaya	Thursday, August 24, 2017 at 7:36pm MST	I think some of it went to pay my CS major fee
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 24, 2017 at 7:36pm MST	I got more too but the additional amount is still processing
Jose Celaya	Thursday, August 24, 2017 at 7:36pm MST	Yeah I was thinking about that

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 21, 2017 at 12:49pm MST	Spin him around???
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 21, 2017 at 12:48pm MST	Just spin him around and then run, if he's dumb he'll think you disappeared

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 8, 2017 at 7:31am MST	@Emanuel I've consulted with my fellow dermatology cohort. We've come to the conclusion you may have been exposed to poison ivy or poison oak
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:19pm MST	Goddamit
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 7, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	@Jose help
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:17pm MST	It could be an allergy. I was shirtless in some dense foliage in Iowa.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:13pm MST	None that I haven't taken before.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:12pm MST	Lol that's true I guess. I will pray for your rash. My guess is it's some environmental allergen you're not used to or some food allergen you didn't realize you had. You start any new protein supplements or anything recently?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:08pm MST	I've taken it for my asthma and Scotts taken it for his Crohn's. It makes both of us roid rage as fuck. Can't stop eating and want to fight every single person we see.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:07pm MST	Sometimes it would feel hot but that was it.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 5:05pm MST	Oh shit that's a pretty strong dose for a first timer. Shit is ridonkulous. You experiencing roid rage yet?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 6, 2017 at 4:56pm MST	Are you in excruciating pain?

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 2:21pm MST	Yall are cray cray. The computational people in my lab do some dope shit. Plus they could do wet lab stuff too if they wanted to.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 2:03pm MST	That's good. So you and Jose don't wanna be computational biologists, right?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 3, 2017 at 1:28pm MST	Someone had a poster on eugenics

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:06pm MST	Olivia you should do something fun one night and completely forget that you ever heard the word &quot;research&quot;
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:05pm MST	Perfect timing
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	Idk I just still feel tired and weak and I'm still a little congested but better than I was.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 2, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	Posters are annoying

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 1, 2017 at 6:09pm MST	Also, does anyone actually say como va?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 31, 2017 at 6:45pm MST	I'm gonna take a break and go shower
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 31, 2017 at 6:45pm MST	Dammit
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 31, 2017 at 6:43pm MST	Fuuuck
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 31, 2017 at 6:27pm MST	Olivia I can't not win this mode
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 31, 2017 at 6:26pm MST	Yeah

Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:56pm MST	I wasn't going to do it until I found out they actually broke up over a year ago because he punched her in the face. She got a restraining order on him because he's crazy obsessive but he manipulated her into getting it lifted and took her on a cruise in Mexico. Also he cheated on her twice when they were together
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:54pm MST	Also he's a huge dick
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:54pm MST	To be fair .. they're not really together
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:51pm MST	Ok this was entertaining but I have a shitload of work to get back to
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:50pm MST	Lol that itself should get you into any grad school

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:49pm MST	Ok now just practice saying it in an endearing voice so you can say it to her
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:47pm MST	Lol
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:46pm MST	What should it be?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:45pm MST	If I were you I would imitate that Trump clip every single time I saw her.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:44pm MST	She's like a 3.5 on a 1-10 scale racist
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:43pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:43pm MST	Jesus Christ.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:43pm MST	And to grow up and get offended by something real
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:43pm MST	Fuck that bitch
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:42pm MST	Wtf how is disabled offensive
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:42pm MST	But not nearly as much
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:41pm MST	No but she's involved in like advocacy for disabled people
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:41pm MST	Instead of saying Donald Trump is retarded, I opt for saying he's a racist douche nozzle
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:40pm MST	Did people lose their shit when they heard you? Lol
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:40pm MST	I thought I was crazy
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:40pm MST	Ok ok
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:40pm MST	And Paul I have the same opinion
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:40pm MST	Assume I say it in a room where no one has a disability
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 26, 2017 at 1:39pm MST	Depends on the crowd. To me it's like a 2, but I've seen people take it as a 9
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:41pm MST	Buenas noches y buena suerte
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:37pm MST	Today I googled what TV shows accurately describe being a doctor

Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:36pm MST	We can't deny him his destiny
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:35pm MST	*him
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:29pm MST	Olivia how are we gonna convince Emanuel to abandon his slum lord ambitions and go to grad school
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:26pm MST	Or did they make up
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:26pm MST	Probably lol it looks like ice cube to me.
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:26pm MST	I imagine every rapper has a song where they say that
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 6:25pm MST	Lmao I have no idea what song you're referring to
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:44pm MST	Ok I'll tell him you're down
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:44pm MST	For real though that sounds dope.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:43pm MST	Lol we will have to formally adopt you then.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:42pm MST	Also, I mentioned to Scott you were interested in welding, he said if you wanna come over sometime he could teach you, he has all the equipment
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:36pm MST	When I was in MARC, my lab was kinda shitty, and some of the stuff was kinda boring, but it wasn't unbearable. I just didn't give a shit. I would start shit super late and not even care. Even now as I'm writing papers and shit, we're closing to being done but it being published isn't that big of a deal
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	I dunno
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 24, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	You decide if you're going to apply to grad programs?

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	Holy shit Daniel you came out of nowhere....It's so fucking stupid right? Like just look at my transcripts and my CV and if you don't feel like I've earned a spot in your program, thanks for your time.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 6:08pm MST	I just feel like it's this fake combination of humble bragging about your accomplishments and self pity about how you were underprivileged but not too underprivileged because God forbid it comes off like a sob story.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 6:05pm MST	Why?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 6:04pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 6:03pm MST	Fast af tho

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 5:58pm MST	Lol I'm not sure how those things are related but I think you should go for it.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 5:58pm MST	I'm consider industrial engineering more and more. In my personal statement, I could talk about how I would get ready so fast as a kid that my dad thought I wasn't brushing my teeth
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 6, 2017 at 5:56pm MST	Always do the weird shit. Also, this lab might actually be more disgusting than the bear poop lab, it's awesome.

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:42am MST	Don't do that, if he throws a fit when you don't eat where he wants, he'll shoot you you if you do that
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:40am MST	Just beat him up
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 9:35am MST	Also, if we're eating as a group and we don't eat where he wants, he will throw a silent fit all day

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 6:25am MST	Already back to grinding.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 6:02am MST	I took several, obviously I'll post the finale but I'll have to decide what else. I saw fireworks on Friday too, and there was a show Saturday but Scotts flight was delayed so we missed it. They do not fuck around with fireworks in Philly
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 6:01am MST	I'm gonna post video later, but I saw them from the waterfront over the Delaware River
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 6:00am MST	He had to leave for the airport at 3pm but he at least got to see the parade.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 5:59am MST	Did Scott agree that it was dope enough to cause an overdose?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 5:59am MST	Olivia was 4th of July in philly as dope as you thought?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 5, 2017 at 5:58am MST	Lol

Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 2, 2017 at 7:49am MST	@Jose Celaya what's that box for your TV called again?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 7:31pm MST	This bar is playing lil yachty. Fuck yes.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	Also did you know that being in Philly, I am closer to Europe than Tucson???
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:34pm MST	Dope af.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:25pm MST	You monster. Everyone needs a cutting board. Fuck pigeons.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:25pm MST	But my kitchen is literally a closet.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:24pm MST	I was in some girls' apartment last night, and I was offended. They didn't have a cutting board and their kitchen trashcan was so small.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:23pm MST	Exactly! I dont know how he's going to fare in my very tiny apartment with two 21 year old girls.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:21pm MST	Scott is such an old man
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:21pm MST	It's the perfect balance of plot, comic relief, and a super good message about how shitty girls treat each other
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:20pm MST	It make more sense why Jose is homesick
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:19pm MST	You're out of control
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:18pm MST	Lol my phone gave me a suggestion to search &quot;mean girls&quot; because of my phrasing lol my phone knows me way too well
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:18pm MST	By people do you mean girls or just a variety of people.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:16pm MST	I was being physically pulled to get grinded on by people dancing. I ddin't want to so I had to resist the people phsyically pulling on me.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:16pm MST	I thought it was a reference to his disapproval that if I possessed his body that I wouldn't pull out. But still doesn't make any more sense.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:15pm MST	Lol ok good it wasn't just me.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:13pm MST	Probably. Like where else would he have gone previously?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:12pm MST	Do you know if this summer is the first time that Jose's not lived with his family?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:11pm MST	Missing that is my biggest disappointment this summer. Well I guess it's tied with Scotts flight being delayed.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:11pm MST	Life is tragic. I even told Jose I missed him. You could've gotten an I miss you message too.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:10pm MST	I know! And I was even up like really late for me. I must have gone to sleep like &lt;10 minutes after you messaged‚Äã us
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 5:08pm MST	I knew it was this weekend, but it got here so fast.

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:46am MST	I feel like shotgunned does not mean shot with a shotgun in this context.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:45am MST	This is the perfect time to mention I shotgunned cheap gas station beer in front of a hair salon last night.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:43am MST	Yes and zoodles
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:43am MST	I made it once before just in a pan. I'm gonna do that again. They're not too thicc

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:19am MST	Yup same over here
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:17am MST	Fuck being president I just wanna be PI
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:17am MST	I really need to apply my organizational skills to my image collection. I know all the memes I have in my phone but they're just in the order they were downloaded they're not organized in anyway so I always know what I'm looking for and roughly where it should be but it still takes me forever to find it
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:14am MST	What's that mean?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:14am MST	I feel like there's a meme in there somewhere
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:13am MST	Yeah they're all just here to hookup with each other.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:13am MST	Ha well ok I can't really argue with that
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:13am MST	I like the people in my lab I talk to them
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:11am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:09am MST	I went to dinner with one of my roommates last night, but other than that I've mostly been avoiding the other people in my program. I do most shit on my own
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:08am MST	I won't deny that
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:08am MST	I guess that's all there is to do in Indianapolis
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:08am MST	I swear though, Tucson sis way more fun
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:07am MST	I mean I've eaten at cool places, went to this one place where they make ice cream with liquid nitrogen. We've played some games together, I've walked around a lot. Gone to the movies
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:05am MST	Emanuel you're getting me homesick again
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:03am MST	Hmm, I don't think I've ever smelled something before rain
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:02am MST	That sounds awesome
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:01am MST	What the fuck is creosote
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:01am MST	And I'm the only non white person in the REU that has 9 people
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:00am MST	Also there is a significant lack of brown people here
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 7:00am MST	Haha that's great
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:59am MST	And there is ZERO shit to do if you're not 21
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:58am MST	I mean it's basically the same size, a little bigger
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:57am MST	I will, I will don't worry
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:57am MST	Tucson blows I never wanna go back
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:56am MST	Paul I can't believe Jose didn't change the air in his tires...
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:56am MST	Lame. Don't die.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:55am MST	Yeah
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:55am MST	What? You're going back home for the weekend?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:54am MST	Which reminds me @Jose did you remember to put summer air in your tires before you left for your program?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:51am MST	That's a good price but damn it still hurts shelling out that much money. But also keep an eye on your gas mileage, I bet it'll go up a little bit.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:49am MST	Nah i kept getting flats with the low pros. Also those were gonna be $800 for the 4 tires. With regulars on 17&quot; wheels I paid $946
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:48am MST	Are they still low profile?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:46am MST	Good you're better off with your car.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 6:40am MST	Thanks. It's the best hat they've had so far.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 7:59pm MST	Jose they lowered raid level to 25
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:54pm MST	I may or may not be able to answer
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:54pm MST	Sounds good
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:53pm MST	Stupid genetic information
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:52pm MST	The extractions never end
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:52pm MST	So fucking relieved. But I'll probably be starting my RNA extractions this week, so not that happy yet lol. But at least one of the other undergrads finished her project so she's going to help me
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:51pm MST	Oh shit
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:49pm MST	I was so sore when I woke up because our lab went white water rafting yesterday so I decided I needed lots of protein
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:48pm MST	Then you should continue the theme
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:48pm MST	Lol that was my breakfast
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:47pm MST	I should've
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:47pm MST	Willing to let it go
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:47pm MST	You already knew that I don't really like cheese, shouldn't you have expected something like this?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:44pm MST	I hope you know I've been playing this whole time.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:43pm MST	We should also agree not to spend real currency to buy lucky eggs and shit. Coins won in gyms are fair game though?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:42pm MST	But if I'm gonna win the race...
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:41pm MST	Not sure
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:40pm MST	I love those
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:40pm MST	Yep
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:37pm MST	Eh that's not a bad race
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:37pm MST	Well it would take 524,000 for you to get to level 25 from where you are now, and it would take 505,000 for me to get to level 32 from where I am now.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:34pm MST	Missed a 0 but yep
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:34pm MST	What's your lifetime xp right now?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:33pm MST	Ok I'm trying to think of a relatively fair goal for each of us hold on.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:32pm MST	We could always race you know...
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:32pm MST	I'll choose to believe
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:30pm MST	Lol but you're almost 1% of the way to level 40
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:28pm MST	That's not ok
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:26pm MST	What the hell?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	That would frustrate me
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:23pm MST	Before that, the Lapras I caught that one day when I ran out of cactus grill was pretty dope, even though it's super weak. Also Porygon is dope af
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:21pm MST	Lol no legendaries still haven't been released.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:20pm MST	You catch mewtwo?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:19pm MST	I've got this poliwag and tediursa
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:17pm MST	I have got to step up my game
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:16pm MST	Apparently I've got 184.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:11pm MST	Holy shit
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:11pm MST	I've caught 780
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:11pm MST	56
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:10pm MST	And yeah if it weren't for the poke stop at my dorm I wouldn't be at this level
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:08pm MST	Today

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:03pm MST	Like when it started last night it was 35+ then it went down to 31+ then it was 28+
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	What is it like level 28+?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	It's not unlocked for my level
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 2:02pm MST	Haha
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 1:30pm MST	These guys have a tilted kilt
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 24, 2017 at 6:30am MST	üçâ

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 22, 2017 at 4:53pm MST	Ugh I rode the bus in the wrong direction. I have been working way too fucking much I'm so dumb now
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, June 22, 2017 at 1:09pm MST	Nice
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 22, 2017 at 8:13am MST	I must have smoked so much I can't even remember smoking. I've been here since 7am but I feel like it's been days, but I'm actually moving pretty quick and making good time
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 10:31am MST	Fuck yeah @Emanuel you take that initiative
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 8:43am MST	Olivia I'm feeling a sincere lack of inspiration

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:24pm MST	The event right now is ending soon I think but I'm getting crazy xp.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 19, 2017 at 2:23pm MST	Shut the fuck up you better not be playing with my heart right now Jose.

Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 11:29am MST	Buy cottage cheese and the rest will follow

Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:15pm MST	Jesus
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:15pm MST	Yeah it's because he hates us
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:14pm MST	You haven't update sus on your life
Daniel Osorio	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:14pm MST	yes
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:14pm MST	Nope...
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:14pm MST	You get your money?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:11pm MST	If they were just being productive and baking then that would be fine. But four college girls in a tiny ass apartment are loud as fuck.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:10pm MST	I'd take that too
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:07pm MST	I just got out of the shower and there are 4 girls trying to make brownies in my kitchen...Fucking kill me
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:06pm MST	Haha, oh my god that looks pretty terrifying
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:03pm MST	Is the new stuff have innovative titles like the beginning?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:02pm MST	https://projects.vrac.iastate.edu/REU2017/interns/emanuel-bustamante/
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:02pm MST	It's definitely a possibility
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 6:00pm MST	Sounds like yes
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:59pm MST	And the have Oculus rifts and 3d printers and shit
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:57pm MST	Not yet. We're doing a whole bunch of reading before we start.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:55pm MST	Hopefully not as bad as it sounds. Are you coding some crazy VR shit?
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 5:43pm MST	There's this pde solver program called flexpde I have to mess with and try to get something working in it by tomorrow. We reviewed stability of Euler's method. But honestly flexpde is gonna take some time, I've spent a few hours on it so far and I haven't gotten far. Also he gave us a packet to review on continuum mechanics.
Jose Celaya	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:14pm MST	Damn. No I should've taken one
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 11:55am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 11:54am MST	Yeah but you'll die successful.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, June 12, 2017 at 7:53am MST	Woke af
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:44pm MST	Alright. In the name of garbage I'm going to bed. If I remember, I'll still message you to make sure you're not late on your first day
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:43pm MST	Probably
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:42pm MST	Don't go up to any old trash can and deeply inhale
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:40pm MST	I mean I guess you can tell me if it's weird or not.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:40pm MST	You need to find a way to quantify trash smell
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	And I don't really want to ship you garbage
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:36pm MST	Yeah maybe but I would think our bags in different places of Tucson would be different
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:34pm MST	The first is that our dumpsters smell just as bad but it's a different bad that we're all accustomed to and we've become nose blind to, so we just don't notice it being that bad day to day.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:33pm MST	I have two hypotheses
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 7:32pm MST	But here, they all smell similar to each other, but it's a way worse dumpster smell than Tucson dumpsters. It's like rancid, it smells so bad
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:15pm MST	Gotchu fam
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:14pm MST	That's what I do anyway.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:13pm MST	I'm gonna have to get a lunch bag
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:10pm MST	Lol this is all shit that either we just bought or still need to buy
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:09pm MST	How do you remember all that? Ok, this is a great list
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:06pm MST	It's that kind of little stuff
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:06pm MST	Right but y'all don't need your own vegetable oil, milk, salt and pepper shakers, aluminum foil, Ziploc bags etc
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:04pm MST	Yeah we have pots and pans
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:03pm MST	I believe in myself
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:03pm MST	Have you literally ever done that?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 4:01pm MST	Yep I'm inspiring as shit
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:59pm MST	Take chances in life Olivia
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:57pm MST	It has 4/5

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:53pm MST	Nah it's still in your brain. Better check yourself or tomorrow's advice is going to be about letting shit go.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:52pm MST	You murdered the memory Olivia
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:52pm MST	Oh my god
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:50pm MST	Other than the annoying ass cochella girl in the background, shit is true.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:49pm MST	Lol I forgot to count myself.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:49pm MST	And there are 5 of us
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:49pm MST	Your wisdom saved me from a middle seat
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:48pm MST	Very down
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:45pm MST	Try to eat dinner by like 6, I think that helps the most. Because I don't feel hungry until it's getting dark, which is super late, but then I don't feel like sleeping until a few hours after I eat and yeah
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:44pm MST	My first meeting is 9 tomorrow
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:44pm MST	I've never tried sleeping pills, I'd be afraid to oversleep
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:43pm MST	It's like a combination of jet lag and your circadian rhythm being all fucking confused by the weird ass sunset. I finally just bought sleeping pills and ear plugs
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:43pm MST	I'll just watch Netflix at night and be miserable in the morning
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:43pm MST	Goddamit
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:43pm MST	Good luck fixing your sleep cycle. Mine was fucked up for like 4 days until I felt normal lol
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	Shiiiiit.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:42pm MST	Yeah EST
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:41pm MST	It's because it's on the edge of the eastern time zone
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:41pm MST	I hope I see more random stuff here
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:40pm MST	Yeah I've done it before in Seattle. But I would rather pay more money and actually ride the horses. It's more expensive but way more worth it, a lot more fun.
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:39pm MST	But to drawn in a carriage
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	Because why not
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	Horse drawn carriages
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:20pm MST	You've become more hardcore
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:20pm MST	Just asking Olivia
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:17pm MST	Olivia why haven't you gotten wasted?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:17pm MST	I think some of my program has one on what's app or something like that. They just all message each other about getting wasted every second of the day
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:15pm MST	Haha, I'll do that. I've only really talked to one. He seemed cool
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:14pm MST	You need to start a group chat with them
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 3:06pm MST	There's my magnificent view
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 1:44pm MST	*view
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 1:44pm MST	Yeah my apartment is super tiny
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 1:43pm MST	Is it dope af?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 1:43pm MST	Just finished settling in
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 12:52pm MST	So Jose? What it do?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 12:10pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 12:07pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 10:26am MST	Nah this is boring now I'm gonna go check out the Delaware River pier. Jose are you in Indiana yet?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 9:08am MST	Yup. I'm at a pride festival but it's entirely too fucking hot to stand in the sun
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:58am MST	Almost noon, like 11:58
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:57am MST	It's the worst. But on the bright side that meal is the best thing I've experienced all day.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:54am MST	Why didn't you just buy that instead of a deluxe breakfast?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:53am MST	Yeah but I can't even eat ramen. I have no pan to heat water, no bowl to eat it out of, and no microwave for the cup of noodles version.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:52am MST	That's what college is for
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:44am MST	Lol well its gonna have to last me through dinner cause I'm still broke af
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:42am MST	I'm eating breakfast as fuck right now
Jose Celaya	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:41am MST	Oh my gosh
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:41am MST	#denveeAsShit
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 11, 2017 at 8:41am MST	Aw that's where you lost your boarding pass remember??
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:00pm MST	Will
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:52pm MST	I'm gonna talk to him. I guess I could always have a computer job and get a welding certificate on the side.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:47pm MST	I mean you can also be trained as a welder at a trade school, I think there's a certification for it. Welders make decent money too, like $15-$25 an hour I imagine.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:44pm MST	I just took a quiz and it said I should be an industrial engineer
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:39pm MST	Out of those, is say bridges
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:36pm MST	Like what kind? Scott will talk your ear off if you have any questions. Most of his friends are the same discipline as him, but I know he has at least one friend in optics and one friend in mining.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:34pm MST	His major is mechanical engineering and his internship is mechanical stuff in aerospace applications, so he's looking for work in either aerospace or defense or something like that.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:25pm MST	Dope af. Apparently a lot of students really like their summer labs and get early admissions, then just visit other schools in the spring just for fun, then go to Penn for grad school and continue in the same lab from the summet.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:24pm MST	That sounds dope
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:19pm MST	But I stand by it.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:17pm MST	M√°s
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:16pm MST	I have 9
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:16pm MST	Yeah in the whole program.

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:15pm MST	40. And 12 of them are from the University of Puerto Rico.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 7:05pm MST	Wow.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:58pm MST	Agreed. These girls are fucking ratchet.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:39pm MST	Yeah. I feel like I'm surrounded by high schoolers.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:38pm MST	So hard
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:38pm MST	Lol nah
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:33pm MST	@Emanuel is everyone in your program getting black out drunk and hooking up with each other?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:16pm MST	That's crazy as fuck.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:15pm MST	We are opposites
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:11pm MST	Emanuel I read your blog
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:48am MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:47am MST	Just checked in and got a mobile boarding pass. I appreciate the nagging, I hate aisle seats.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:39am MST	I thought that was just assigned

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:37am MST	You can do it Jose.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 9:33am MST	That was one time

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:49am MST	So do that then
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:49am MST	That's what she said first, but then she emailed me telling me to ask my advisor
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:48am MST	I told her that uaccess didn't say that, and that I didn't apply for graduation, and that my expected grad date did say may 2017, but that it said I hadn't graduated.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:47am MST	What record? Did you tell her all that?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 8:07am MST	Well I hope Indianapolis has dope hookah lounges
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, June 10, 2017 at 6:08am MST	You don't have your own mini fridge dedicated to eggs?

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 9, 2017 at 6:52am MST	üçâ

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 9, 2017 at 6:42am MST	Hey y'all don't forget to email Cindy back that info today
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 7, 2017 at 3:54pm MST	Down af
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 7, 2017 at 2:26pm MST	Well when you get it you can go all out because you've been effectively forced to save money
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 7, 2017 at 2:22pm MST	Yeah hopefully. I mean I'm not starving yet lol they've been feeding us a bunch, I have a little bit of money but if I had known it would take this long I would have planned differently lol

Jose Celaya	Friday, June 2, 2017 at 7:33pm MST	Yeah it's based on French
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 2, 2017 at 7:33pm MST	Yup. It's not just Mexican though. They also played Haitian music in Creole which I think is like French? But different somehow?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 2, 2017 at 7:30pm MST	I think Scott and I are gonna go back to that dope ass hookah lounge.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 2, 2017 at 7:29pm MST	In Iowa?

Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 11:49am MST	Ya casi?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 11:27am MST	And @Emanuel, basically I was planning on visiting Chicago sometime this summer since it's just a medium length bus ride away, then I realized how close you guys were also and was wondering if you'd hypothetically be down
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 11:20am MST	It's gonna be a while longer...
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 10:18am MST	What's your question @Jose Celaya?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 10:01am MST	I can do 11:30
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:56am MST	I'll be done around 11:30 but I can plan to come down earlier
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:45am MST	Do you wanna come by after you meet your PI
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:45am MST	You're the worst.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:43am MST	Maybe my charger and I aren't meant to be together
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:43am MST	Dammit

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:44am MST	I have a meeting with my PI right at 11 but I can meet you a little before or a little after outside drachman hall
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:43am MST	The roundabout doesn't exist anymore, its been demolished.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:43am MST	You there then?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:42am MST	I have to go to my stupid lab and I don't want to....But I'll have my charger‚Äã with me if you wanna stop by.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:41am MST	That also makes sense
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:39am MST	Makes sense, but you'll only need to uber once right?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:37am MST	Or they pick you up in a limo with a pool
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:37am MST	Like a car pool but with Uber?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:35am MST	Like if it's cheap and drinkable nearby I might be better off just buying it on my way to lab.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:34am MST	Yeah I probably will also buy a Keurig depending on the state of coffee near my apartment, idk yet.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:33am MST	I don't know what to buy
Jose Celaya	Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 6:33am MST	Emanuel was gonna buy a keurig

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 8:45am MST	Emanuel when do your current living accommodations end?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 9, 2017 at 10:06pm MST	I will check with management to see if there are any vacancies.

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 9, 2017 at 9:31pm MST	If you bring me shit to make drinks, I can make like 5 drinks probably.

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 9, 2017 at 10:36am MST	Well except physics but I don't count that
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 9, 2017 at 10:07am MST	That would probably be beneficial. I have to finish my study guide first
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, May 9, 2017 at 6:29am MST	Hey y'all it's gonna be pretty chilly today, might wanna bring a jacket

Jose Celaya	Monday, May 8, 2017 at 3:13pm MST	...ok, not sure if that's good or bad, but I'll defer to your wisdom
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, May 8, 2017 at 3:12pm MST	There are some things better left unsaid
Jose Celaya	Monday, May 8, 2017 at 3:11pm MST	You get your A?

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, May 8, 2017 at 11:50am MST	I like the basement more.

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, May 8, 2017 at 11:49am MST	Nevemind. I saw your message.

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:33pm MST	Cause you're going to prom you dumdum
Jose Celaya	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:31pm MST	Just wondering why the advice now?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:27pm MST	Wear a condom Jose
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:11pm MST	We should get some free coffee from slot canyon.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:09pm MST	Oh shit.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 1:06pm MST	Thanks fam
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 11:03am MST	You could do it. I believe in you.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:49am MST	I'd like to be pregnant but I don't want to give birth
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:39am MST	I think we should just be happy that at this moment none of us are pregnant
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:37am MST	Mostly cause if/when we have a baby, he'll get to pay for that shit which is way more expensive üíØ
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:32am MST	Yeah. Then again I don't make Scott pay for any of it.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:27am MST	Lol no condoms are neutral. Cause they protect you too.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:22am MST	Lol what about all the birth control you didn't pay for?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:20am MST	I should be paid back for half of the plan b I've bought.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 9:11am MST	Scott and I are grabbing breakfast then having a homework party in the science and engineering library if any of y'all wanna come party it up.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:33pm MST	Holy shit
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:27pm MST	First the life fruit. Can only be grown by a sim with gardening level 7+. No problem, one of the twins is a scientist. Scoured the city for this special, unidentified seed and found it. 3 game days later I harvest it.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:25pm MST	There's a bit coming
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:24pm MST	The book can only be read by someone maxed out on their cooking level. No problem, my ghost mom spends like half a day reading the shit out of the book.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:22pm MST	Why does productivity suck?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:21pm MST	But then I notice, the ghost parents are still aging on their age bar. Like I kinda assumed that once they come back as a ghost, they just stay a ghost forever, but I guess they're going to eventually die again? Or something I'm not really sure. But it sucks because my household is super fucking productive.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:18pm MST	That sounds awesome to me
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:16pm MST	So mom dad and three adult children, right. Dad finally gets old and dies. Mom is getting old too. She completes a quest that lets her bring him back from the dead as a ghost. So now he's back and he's a ghost right.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:14pm MST	I was trying to tell @Emanuel Bustamante why I wanted to die, but I guess he's too busy to acknowledge my existence.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:12pm MST	Hey hey
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:12pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:06pm MST	But I guess I'll do it now so you don't call me a walnut
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:06pm MST	And procrastination has served me well so far
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:06pm MST	Hey hey, I only knew a week in advance
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	Well, looks like I have some stuff to do tomorrow morning
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	They're at different flower shops. Also the 2nd one doesn't say a price.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:04pm MST	Whichever one you like better, but at least that way you have two options in case it's too last minute.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 5:00pm MST	Cool cool
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:59pm MST	This one is pretty but I'm still looking.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:54pm MST	Lol what is he ignoring you about paul
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	Literally every other girl at the prom will have one. She would be the only one without one.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	I have no idea
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:51pm MST	Goddamit
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:51pm MST	I'm not sure
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:51pm MST	Eh Olivia
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:50pm MST	Emanuel I want to die.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:50pm MST	Get a dope ass one
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:49pm MST	I'm sure it's not too late, why don't you look
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:48pm MST	After all the work Scott and I put into making you look dope for prom.
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:48pm MST	I succeeded
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:48pm MST	Dammit Jose.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:48pm MST	Lol*
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:46pm MST	Jose did you order a corsage
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:42pm MST	I'll take the fact that you're writing this as proof that you survived McCann's?
Jose Celaya	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 4:42pm MST	Haha will do
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, May 5, 2017 at 9:50am MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:27pm MST	I'm pretty sure. It's also in one of the homework solutions
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:11pm MST	Was the homework hard?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:10pm MST	Maybe less than 6
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:09pm MST	I did everything except up to but not including logic langs in like 5 hours. I'm going to the library at 4 tomorrow to finish up the stuff for the last couple weeks, I'm probably not gonna go over prolog much, since I remember it pretty well. Also I gotta do some analysis. Long story short you could probably finish the whole thing in 8-9 hours
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 9:06pm MST	@Jose Celaya how long did it take you to study for McCann?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 7:35pm MST	I don't know if you've left yet but yeah.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 5:59pm MST	@Emanuel Bustamante you gonna do any more studying today?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 1:45pm MST	We are taking a break from analysis shit.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 1:43pm MST	Who's on campus?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:22pm MST	Be there in 5
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:22pm MST	I'll get a drink
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:21pm MST	I'm gonna eat at cactus if you wanna join
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:19pm MST	Eh why not, I don't have anything to do until the demo
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:19pm MST	You going?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 3:00pm MST	Well, if you decide to join the world, homeworking/Studying/trying to die will probably commence around 5
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 10:57am MST	I'm definitely gonna consider that.
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 10:55am MST	Anyone down for a HW party around 5?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:54am MST	I only had that and one other comment
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:53am MST	Lol that's weird. She just gave me some grammar shit to change.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:51am MST	But did you use justified alignment throughout? And why did your font color change?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:49am MST	Weird. I still have to do my revisions.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:48am MST	Can't remember the exact comment but It was somewhere along the lines of &quot;starting here the spacing is inconsistent and the text seems lighter. If you copied and pasted either paraphrase of show a direct quote&quot;
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:46am MST	I mean I don't use justified, but couldn't she just do a Google search to see if you plagiarized?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 9:43am MST	She thought‚Äã I copied and pasted because I justified my paper
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 12:15am MST	Now every time I see her I'm gonna think of Julia
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, May 2, 2017 at 4:04pm MST	We're down
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, May 2, 2017 at 4:03pm MST	You traitor
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, May 2, 2017 at 3:38pm MST	@Emanuel d√≥nde est√°s?

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, May 1, 2017 at 9:37am MST	Ok I'll definitely be done by then.
Jose Celaya	Monday, May 1, 2017 at 9:13am MST	Also, reminder to everyone that the paper is due Wednesday
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, May 1, 2017 at 8:51am MST	We should have a homework party today.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 6:13pm MST	Fuck em. He's not even alive.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 6:12pm MST	I just don't know what to do, like should I feed him?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 5:11pm MST	My brain is on some next level language shit. I grew up speaking two languages and I know sever computer langauges.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 5:09pm MST	god damn it. Ignore that comma
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 5:08pm MST	Nope
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 30, 2017 at 5:08pm MST	Your chance to say that already expired.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 11:49am MST	Almost there
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 11:32am MST	How far away are you?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 11:32am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 11:30am MST	Oh ok that's not bad sometimes they get pretty busy on the weekends near lunch time. We are leaving Narnia again.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 11:29am MST	There's a good amount of cars, but like 5 or 6 open spots
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 29, 2017 at 11:27am MST	Ok. Is it busy there?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:06pm MST	I'll let you know tomorrow when I find out what my Sims schedule is like.
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:52pm MST	Thanks Olivia
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:51pm MST	Ok ask her and if you can get a pic just of the fabric to make it easier to match, it doesn't have to be the whole dress.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:47pm MST	Yes, these are things that come with the tux, you just pick what color you want. I would ask her.
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:38pm MST	But I mean a tux is black right? Black goes with everything
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:38pm MST	Do you know what your friend is wearing??? Like what color her dress is
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 8:46pm MST	No yeah that's cool. Why would I be embarrassed?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 8:42pm MST	You should do it this weekend though, like the sooner the better. It's a seasonal thing and alterations take a few days, so places are probably getting slammed right about now.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 8:41pm MST	Ok I am definitely down. I will ask Scott, he's trying on pants right now.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 6:54pm MST	I would've been down though haha
Daniel Osorio	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 6:47pm MST	sorry, I went shopping
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 5:58pm MST	Yeah. For four please.

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 5:02pm MST	I apologize for the terrible resolution.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 5:01pm MST	I dont want to pretend.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 5:01pm MST	Pretend that was a period.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 5:00pm MST	That would be dope?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:59pm MST	Emanuel would you like me to pick you up when I leave lab
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:59pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:58pm MST	But I've never ordered alcohol there.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:58pm MST	Well I mean I think they have a few beers and like red and white wine by the glass.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:58pm MST	I could live off of kale
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:58pm MST	You could just live in Narnia. It's nice there. Except the rodents
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:57pm MST	Yep
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:55pm MST	Oh shit.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:54pm MST	Idk I want something delicious. And I would like to not be at the u of a.
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:54pm MST	Any non bar place would be cool to eat at
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:54pm MST	And Scott is changing his oil so he might meet up with us a little later.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:53pm MST	Where do you wanna eat?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:53pm MST	I have like 15 minutes left til I'm done transferring my blot, then I will be a free house elf.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:53pm MST	Where are you?
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	No
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	No because I didn't register it after I bought it
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	Don't you just have to renew it though?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:51pm MST	Oh snaps. Did you register the shit out of your car?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:50pm MST	Ok but I don't want to eat or drink there.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 4:45pm MST	Emanuel where abouts is your location?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 2:08pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:31am MST	She said one of my sentences was too long and deleted a lot of commas
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:29am MST	Oh
Jose Celaya	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:26am MST	I haven't looked at mine yet
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:24am MST	Lol well that's good then.
Daniel Osorio	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:23am MST	not that much
Daniel Osorio	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:20am MST	she said mine wasn't long enough
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:17am MST	Did y'all get the revisions from Cindy? Mine were all super small changes in grammar and rewording some of my longer sentences, that's it...
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 11:11am MST	Fucking ridiculous.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 28, 2017 at 9:56am MST	They left your kale alone. They said fuck that shit and went all the way to the next plot and took a fucking pepper plant. They would rather eat a banana pepper plant than your fucking kale.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, April 27, 2017 at 6:45pm MST	Give them one last kiss from me
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 27, 2017 at 12:40pm MST	@Emanuel Bustamante look at that doggo

Jose Celaya	Thursday, April 27, 2017 at 9:29am MST	Also Emanuel, I thought I'd reciprocate with more math memes
Jose Celaya	Thursday, April 27, 2017 at 8:57am MST	Keep that attitude and you'll ace the shit out of your finals
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 9:16pm MST	@Jose Celaya
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 8:53pm MST	Exactly
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 8:52pm MST	We need more logarithmically scaled memes in our lives
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 8:52pm MST	Haha, I like that one, graham schmidt is horrible
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 7:25pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 7:23pm MST	My last final is the 8th
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 7:22pm MST	It can be next week or early on the week after, my final is the 11th at 8am.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 7:15pm MST	Kk.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 3:55pm MST	I am a hoe , this is accurate

Jose Celaya	Tuesday, April 25, 2017 at 9:38am MST	Free at 12
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, April 25, 2017 at 9:24am MST	Anyone free around 11?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, April 25, 2017 at 8:51am MST	I gotta do something at ten and still shower and shit.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, April 25, 2017 at 8:31am MST	Watch the video. Does anyone wanna hang out for like an hour?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, April 25, 2017 at 8:30am MST	Caged cunt.

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, April 24, 2017 at 10:42am MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, April 24, 2017 at 10:40am MST	A heating pad helps. Beyond that I recommend Advil and aspercreme or other arthritis cream. that shit is dope, I'd offer you some but mine is at home
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, April 24, 2017 at 10:39am MST	Like the rolly foam things they have at the gym. Nevermind then.
Jose Celaya	Monday, April 24, 2017 at 10:35am MST	And I think she'll grade on completion mostly, but also read over the paper to make sure you actually put a bit of effort into it and that it makes sense
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, April 24, 2017 at 10:34am MST	Do you think she'll grade on content or completion?
Jose Celaya	Monday, April 24, 2017 at 10:33am MST	Same
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, April 24, 2017 at 10:32am MST	I'm on page 4
Jose Celaya	Monday, April 24, 2017 at 10:24am MST	Or are you like the girl in the gif?
Jose Celaya	Monday, April 24, 2017 at 10:23am MST	Olivia are you done?

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 9:51pm MST	Are you sure you won't be busy???
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 9:51pm MST	Jose are you sure you want to do homework with emanuel at 5?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 9:19pm MST	I mean it is just a rough draft
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 9:04pm MST	Cindy lol

Jose Celaya	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 7:32pm MST	I haven't done references
Jose Celaya	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 7:31pm MST	No
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 7:30pm MST	Only 2 cocktails in lol. How's your paper coming
Jose Celaya	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 7:29pm MST	Love that show
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 4:40pm MST	I'll drink with you
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 4:39pm MST	Come get drunk at the hookah lounge
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 4:36pm MST	I know but I haven't started drinking yet so I'm still miserable
Jose Celaya	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 4:35pm MST	Nope
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 4:35pm MST	Ok but she didn't say how many sources we have to have?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 4:32pm MST	Also, are we required to do in text citation a, or can we just lost them all at the end?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 3:36pm MST	Fucking love snoop
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 3:22pm MST	I'm hanging out with Jose and you're not
Jose Celaya	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 3:22pm MST	I will
Jose Celaya	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 11:09am MST	How about science library, I can park there.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 11:01am MST	Let's do one. Where do you wanna meet?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 10:42am MST	When do you wanna meet up?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 8:30am MST	I figured as much. And I have little hope that emanuel has a secret pepper stash in his dorm. I was hoping @Daniel Osorio or @Paul Acosta Estrada could maybe hook me up with some dope shit
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:02pm MST	It's past my bedtime I'm going to bed dammit
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:01pm MST	You should write a paper about yawning
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:01pm MST	The sympathetic yawn? Animals do that. Shit is weird.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:01pm MST	Also, apparently kids under six don't get they urge to yawn when they see other people yawn
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:59pm MST	Lol ok yawn expert
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:59pm MST	There's no air in there
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:58pm MST	It's not true yawning though.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:58pm MST	What no they dont
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:58pm MST	Holy shit. Fetuses yawn too
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:57pm MST	Birds look weird when they yawn
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:56pm MST	*noches
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:55pm MST	Did you know that owls' eyes are tube shaped?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:54pm MST	Nothing venomous. Plus a king snake would keep rattle snakes out of my yard. Alright that's my new plan. When I wake up I'm gonna figure out how to bait and trap a king snake.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:52pm MST	*put
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:52pm MST	I should just out a fucking snake out there!
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:51pm MST	Make an owl playlist on spotify
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:50pm MST	I dunno. Is there any trees where the owls could live?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:50pm MST	Just have a recording of owl sounds playing
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:48pm MST	Basically have plants that attract rodents, providing a place for them to live.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:37pm MST	Traps, poison, putting dry ice in the tunnels, attracting predators (owls)
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:33pm MST	Idk maybe buy more of that repellant and put it inside the plots and around the plants. I already used one whole bottle but it seems to be working so maybe I just need more.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:31pm MST	What can you do?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:30pm MST	Did you sprinkle that one shit?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:11pm MST	@Emanuel Bustamante if these fucking moles take one more of my goddamn plants I'm gonna gas the fuck out of them.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:16pm MST	write(&quot;Oh yeah, I forgot&quot;), nl, !.
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 4:06pm MST	What is up
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 11:04am MST	Are you even actually Japanese?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:54am MST	Do you guys know any good places to eat ramen?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:35am MST	So tomorrow sound ok?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:35am MST	Yeah, just two more weeks though
Jose Celaya	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:30am MST	I'm down, would you be up to meet tomorrow though?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:29am MST	I wish.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:20am MST	Damn. I thought you expelled your sinus infection already
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, April 22, 2017 at 10:19am MST	That stupid paper
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 10:10pm MST	I know. But the relief is real
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 10:09pm MST	That's some nasty ass shit
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 10:03pm MST	And on that disgusting note I'm going to bed. I will pray for your sinuses.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 10:03pm MST	Ignore the guy with the black mucus, he had sinus surgery, but any of the pics with mucus in the hands or tissues is pretty accurate.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:56pm MST	I highly recommend one. They're cheap, and honestly you could probably make/find something with a similar function. The packets that you put in it are just baking soda and salt, so you don't HAVE to buy one.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:54pm MST	I'm so fucking excited
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:53pm MST	And you will breathe like you've never breathed before.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:53pm MST	I've had it happen the next day, or even up to 2 weeks later, but you'll be blowing your nose and then a massive glob will come out of your nostril, like stringy and bloody as fuck with a hard center. It'll just keep coming and coming out of your nose, basically it's just this huge cluster of white blood cells and dead bacteria
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:40pm MST	But a sinus infection could definitely cause pressure to build up and you might just feel it in your ear. Is this your first sinus infection?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:34pm MST	Yesterday it was on one side, but today it's on this side and more painful.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:33pm MST	MY finger cannot reach where it hurts
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:31pm MST	Did your ear ever hurt?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:31pm MST	Not to my knowledge no, but I've had sinus infections.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:30pm MST	(This is me trying to keep the group chat alive since nobody has said anything all day)
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, April 21, 2017 at 9:30pm MST	Are you okay?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 4:15pm MST	Hey Emanuel, I actually left early today, I'm not on campus. So I won't be working on it today.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 11:53am MST	Lol I feel like that would apply to a variety of garden pests.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 10:21am MST	I have no idea I've never dealt with moles.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 10:13am MST	How do we kill them?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 9:55am MST	Dope
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 9:49am MST	We have beans.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 9:46am MST	What is it?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, April 19, 2017 at 4:56pm MST	üçâ
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, April 19, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	That'll do it
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, April 19, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	I'm still getting used to the birth control which makes me nauseous sometimes, plus I had a margarita and smoked a bunch of hookah
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, April 19, 2017 at 4:52pm MST	Like sick?
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, April 19, 2017 at 4:51pm MST	In front of Gould Simpson
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, April 19, 2017 at 4:50pm MST	What? I just left like 5 minutes ago
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, April 19, 2017 at 4:50pm MST	Haha
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, April 19, 2017 at 4:49pm MST	Que onda
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, April 19, 2017 at 3:36pm MST	I'm joining the circus
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, April 19, 2017 at 3:35pm MST	Ok you've convinced me
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, April 19, 2017 at 3:34pm MST	Ah ok, I'm booked til 5. Too bad

You can fit it in even if they dont specifically ask for volunteer stuff, but if they dont ask any of those other types of things they probably dont give a shit.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, January 26, 2017 at 1:00pm MST	Like as a volunteer service that I've done

Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, January 9, 2017 at 10:15pm MST	I've kinda been phoning it in since it was a good job to have, and she's the kinda person that incessantly harps on things. Now that I'm in MARC, she's been pushy

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 6:26pm MST	But Scott's step-dad did put barbecue sauce on his pigs in a blanket, so.....
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 5:57pm MST	Are pigs in a blanket whiter than macaroni and hot dogs?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:50pm MST	Great now I want Mexican food
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 31, 2016 at 4:48pm MST	It's best to jump right into the deep end

Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 25, 2016 at 6:32pm MST	I'm very confused.

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:56pm MST	I know right.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:43pm MST	It's definitely worth the energy investment
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:39pm MST	That sounds like a lot of work...
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 24, 2016 at 5:38pm MST	But I can't be naked.

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 12, 2016 at 11:36am MST	I can hop on the green or purple so that's pretty much anywhere on main campus
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 12, 2016 at 11:36am MST	I would prefer an outlet but it's not necessary. I have no other preference
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 12, 2016 at 11:34am MST	Anyone on campus wanna study with me til my 1pm final?

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 11, 2016 at 4:34pm MST	Scott is wondering if any of y'all recognize that math symbol
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 10, 2016 at 9:42am MST	I just wanna say if we're late it's entirely Scott's fault
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 10, 2016 at 9:37am MST	Scott and I are about to leave.

Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 10, 2016 at 9:12am MST	Si
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 10, 2016 at 9:11am MST	Here we go. Sounds like someone's gonna be late...

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, December 9, 2016 at 3:56pm MST	I'm so happy right now. That was perfect.
Jose Celaya	Friday, December 9, 2016 at 3:15pm MST	Guys, I think the praying might've worked
Jose Celaya	Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 9:47pm MST	Yeah, I was just doing direct translation
Jose Celaya	Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 9:45pm MST	I'm probably missing something
Jose Celaya	Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 9:45pm MST	Maybe it's like &quot;he's positively gay&quot;
Jose Celaya	Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 9:42pm MST	Neither do I
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 9:41pm MST	Ohhhh ok

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 7:05pm MST	I will when he starts lecturing again.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 7:02pm MST	Fuck em
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:42pm MST	That is the best thing I have read this entire day
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:22pm MST	I'm not even thinking about grad school apps. And I plan shit wayyyyy ahead.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:21pm MST	Given they are things I need to do, but I don't want to think about my rec letter for grad school during finals week
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:19pm MST	If it's just us, like 20minites
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:19pm MST	?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:19pm MST	Not long at all
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:18pm MST	Cause I have class at 5...
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:18pm MST	Fucking do it. Right after your ballet recital
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:18pm MST	I wanna do it myself.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:17pm MST	Yeah. I hate going there.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:15pm MST	Yeah
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:14pm MST	O have to present Wednesday, but I think I'm gonna take it off anyways and let them know.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:11pm MST	Yeah really you should only be required to do 9 based on your credits right? You're taking 3 credits?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:10pm MST	And 14 because I've said fuck this gonna spend less times anyways
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:09pm MST	That's bullshit
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:09pm MST	They wanted me to do 16 and I've been doing about 14.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:08pm MST	How much time do you spend in the lab
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 6:07pm MST	Talk to Cindy
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 4:08pm MST	Because unwrapping is the best part
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 4:07pm MST	Goddammit Paul why you gotta go and make us other Santa's look bad.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 4:07pm MST	Lol no
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 3:59pm MST	Are y'all wrapping your present?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 2:02pm MST	I'm jealous
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:48am MST	It's ok
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:48am MST	Um, since my class is at 12:30. I guess I'll just stay here
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:42am MST	Jose I have a table
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:37am MST	Second option sounds best
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:36am MST	So Scott finally got ahold of his professor. He told Scott either he could talk to the girl and turn in his own report and put that she contributed 0% or they could submit the one she did, put that they each did 50% and Scott could email his separately, then the professor would determine whether plagiarism had occurred and deal with her specifically.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:18am MST	I am not free at all today üòï
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:17am MST	Cool
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:13am MST	What time?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:09am MST	But can one truly appreciate the light in life without the dark?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:19am MST	Can her turn in both?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:18am MST	Just let her say she did all of the parts that were plagiarized
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:16am MST	Anyway so Scott emailed his professor, and tried to be as upfront and forthcoming as possible, but his professor never emailed him back.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:15am MST	Wow that was weird. Anyway, they only turned in hard copies, not electronic copies on d2l which is why his professor didn't catch it the first time. But there's no doubt. Like it's copy pasted
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 9:12am MST	She had a citation section, but it only had like 2 citations. She didn't have any in text citations, no quotes around the paragraph, nothing, just blatant plagiarism.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 3:04pm MST	Lol
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 3:01pm MST	üçâ
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 3:00pm MST	Is anyone at PSU?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 12:02pm MST	It sounds made up
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:52am MST	Also, is anyone still going to PSU today?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:36am MST	I don't understand the question but I trust Jose.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:34am MST	I'm way too old for this shit.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:33am MST	Like I still need to finish my paper, it's due next week, then I need to make my poster and present it, then make a PowerPoint and present that
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:32am MST	Think about Christmasy things
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:21am MST	I bet someone from my lab is going to come...
Jose Celaya	Monday, December 5, 2016 at 11:18am MST	Usually being alphabetically first is a good thing, well at least I'll get it over with
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:19pm MST	Yes, there is in fact a clan of Wu Tang.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:16pm MST	Damn ok.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:16pm MST	That's too hip for even me
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:10pm MST	Maybe talk to your PI about a different project then?
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 2:10pm MST	The project. I don't see any point to it.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 8:49am MST	Like across the bike path from Yavapai, directly west?
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 5:29pm MST	We can beat up the cold for you.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 5:29pm MST	Do you think you're gonna make it?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 5:26pm MST	Guys I think it might finally be happening. I think I'm finally catching a cold.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 3:44pm MST	Someone should make sure daniel knows
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 3:33pm MST	üçâ
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 2:59pm MST	Are we all going to emanuel's recital that he forgot to tell us about?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 9:37am MST	Probably just going out to bars, nothing special
Jose Celaya	Saturday, December 3, 2016 at 7:38am MST	Happy birthday Paul!
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 11:41am MST	Those motherfuckers
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, December 1, 2016 at 11:17am MST	Turn around
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 30, 2016 at 8:07pm MST	And here's this one again for comparison. I can't decide which is my favorite
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 30, 2016 at 12:08pm MST	I'll be back from meeting my PI at about 2:20, so I'll drop by then if you're still there.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 30, 2016 at 12:07pm MST	Probably cactus grill but I'm up for whatever
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 30, 2016 at 12:07pm MST	Where at?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 1:24pm MST	Anyone free? I have an hour to kill
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:09am MST	Yeah I didn't mention anything specific about research applications or anything, just my general interests in the scope of microbiology
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:08am MST	I told her the same thing as Emanuel said, but I didn't know what else to say
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 11:08am MST	I did exactly what emanuel did

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, November 25, 2016 at 5:55pm MST	Guys I fucking hate my postdoc.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 5:51pm MST	I'd be an amazing ass fish Paul
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 4:58pm MST	Also a dead one
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 4:58pm MST	You would be a ratchet fish
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, November 24, 2016 at 11:19am MST	I already submitted that shit so I don't remember. It wasn't very good though
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:24pm MST	Even cheese would be dead?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	Sweet. You can thank bacteria for that delicious cheese you're eating.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:01pm MST	Yeah, the bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc in poop
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:01pm MST	Or you want your life to be about poop?

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:58pm MST	And those are the only ones contagious enough and deadly enough to worry about. And ebola is the only one without a vaccine, and that's almost done too.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:55pm MST	You're not scared you'll accidentally get some crazy disease?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:51pm MST	Sounds good. Let me know when you get there.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:51pm MST	Yeah I'm gonna be making vaccines and shit.

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 11:59am MST	He hates us.

Jose Celaya	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 9:37am MST	Around 12?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at 8:55am MST	Anybody want to go to Boston market with me for lunch?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 9:48pm MST	I know. I'm thoroughly enjoying it
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 9:46pm MST	Haha, where do you find all these?

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	Somebody kill me. Put me out of my misery.
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	He subconsciously wants to tweet
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:46pm MST	And it sounds like twerk
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:45pm MST	I'm dying in my physics class
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:27pm MST	Only if you're a good son.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:09pm MST	That's the last time I offer to beat someone up for you
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:09pm MST	You have a valid point
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 6:05pm MST	not te dejes
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 5:26pm MST	You may be right

Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 4:26pm MST	Just tell her to stop being all vindictive.

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:18pm MST	If he owns up to it, then we'll work it out. If not I'll ask him how long he's been smoking and lying to me about it, and it'll be a shit storm.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:15pm MST	How sure are you that he's still smoking?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:09pm MST	Fair enough Paul, that's how I see it too. When he gets home I'm gonna give him an opportunity to fess up.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:08pm MST	He's at fault for lying, you're at fault for snooping. If you accept your fault for snooping, then I think the lying outweighs the snooping
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:05pm MST	Did you want him to stop?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 12:48pm MST	If Scott left something in plain site which made me think he's doing something fucking bad and then I snoop and find a lot of shit that definitely proves he's doing something fucking bad

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 22, 2016 at 12:05pm MST	On the page after you click the link in the email.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 22, 2016 at 11:27am MST	That's true.

Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, September 16, 2016 at 10:24am MST	I would be perfectly okay with no hw party today
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:47pm MST	Or to you for standing up for women in science
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:43pm MST	Or pray to Rosalind Franklin, since she did most of the work
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:34pm MST	Don't worry we'll pray. And not that fake ass praying you guys did for me before my test. You got it fam

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:30pm MST	Lol what is Jesus the grim reaper now too? He's in charge of taking people who are expired?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:30pm MST	To make him happy you gotta devote your whole life and stuff.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:27pm MST	If you're not even old enough to drink, you're definitely not 2000+ years old
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:26pm MST	Prove it
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 1:26pm MST	I'm pretty sure Jesus was born before you paul

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 11:09am MST	That sounds reasonable to me.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 10:39am MST	Yeah I nailed the amino acids part. It was just a ridiculously hard test. But I figure it's worth 100pts, and there were 19 questions, so each one has to be worth 6pts, so there were 114 possible, so I could miss up to 4 and still get an A...right?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 10:37am MST	It's the polar one with the ring.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, September 15, 2016 at 10:35am MST	Omg fuck that test. I feel like you guys did not pray hard enough.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 7:22pm MST	Olivia your study session helped me so much with my next hw assignment. It's all on amino acids
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 7:05pm MST	Omfg. I'm still in my review session, and remembering tireswing has a ring actually worked to remind me of tyrosine. And iso=1 for isoleucine...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 1:18pm MST	Why is there always a cat Tran just parked there?

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 8:06pm MST	I texted you emanuel can you paste it cause I'm dumb
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 7:23pm MST	I asked Cindy if it's lab funding or our marc funding, she said it's our sources of funding. So I just put the MARC grant that we included on our summer posters. But you probably want to include your scholarships I'm guessing?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 6:57pm MST	Did you guys fill out the info sheet?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, September 7, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	When is it due?

Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, September 4, 2016 at 5:50pm MST	I like being crossed. It's all the desire to dance of being drunk and all the relaxation of being high.

Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 26, 2016 at 11:40pm MST	Or Jos√© could marry big Olivia, and you could marry little Olivia, and then you guys would be like brothers.

Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:16pm MST	I came to the cafe in ENR2 to get us a spot, cause I have nothing better to do and like every table is full
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 22, 2016 at 2:16pm MST	I decided that I hate the regular semester. Everywhere is so nice and empty during the summer.

Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 3:42pm MST	You have to set up your job direct deposit and your refund direct deposit separately
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 7:36pm MST	Financial aid has a personal vendetta against us.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:26pm MST	Yes
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:25pm MST	It's a damn small mill Olivia
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:24pm MST	Why does nobody care about my question?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:20pm MST	Emanuel the financial aid office hates us
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:14pm MST	You don't have direct deposit though right?
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 6:04pm MST	I have 100% faith in Cindy
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 3:57pm MST	Hopefully Cindy comes to the rescue
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 3:18pm MST	Yup.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 2:33pm MST	What'd she do?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 1:47pm MST	You could try to get a ballet scholarship
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 1:46pm MST	I'm gonna have strip my way through college now.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 9:34am MST	Nope. Nothing.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 9:08am MST	No email? The direct deposit isn't there yet, just the email.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 9:00am MST	I got an email saying my direct deposit is processing.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 19, 2016 at 9:00am MST	Praise the Lord Jesus Christ amen.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 3:08pm MST	Your marriage isn't gonna work unless you can let little things like that go.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 3:07pm MST	Nice initiative
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 3:05pm MST	Oh so you were talking to your future bride already?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 3:03pm MST	You should just marry her already Jose.
Jose Celaya	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 2:51pm MST	Why?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 2:51pm MST	I'm confused now
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 2:50pm MST	That was Olivia wasn't it?
Jose Celaya	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 2:50pm MST	Besides, she pronounces gif with a hard g, it would never work
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:19am MST	I think so too, Scott got his a few days ago...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:09am MST	Lol I don't think so
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:04am MST	I don't know.. I'm super broke too
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 10:36am MST	I don't know. Does our insurance cover dental stuff?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 9:13am MST	Is UAccess ass for everyone or is it just me?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 2:11pm MST	Why is that?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 2:05pm MST	Lol I guess so. I'm sitting in the book store right now, and I've decided this school is full of douche nozzles.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 2:05pm MST	Well he's had to be nice to you because of your shitty mentor
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:59pm MST	I don't really mind him all that much
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:46pm MST	I blame Dr. Tischler
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 17, 2016 at 1:26pm MST	Thank God I'm not the only one. I was starting to freak the fuck out
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:55pm MST	Damn. Scott and I fly back into phoenix tomorrow night, and we're pretty sure he left the lights on in his jeep, so we're pretty sure the battery is gonna be dead Ûæå£
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:51pm MST	Unfortunately no
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:51pm MST	We saw 3 lions.
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:49pm MST	Btw I saw a lion today
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:48pm MST	For Asian Aslan?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:48pm MST	Like you were revealing a secret fetish that you have.
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:43pm MST	Mostly highway though. Inside is nice and clean
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:43pm MST	208
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:43pm MST	Hehe
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:43pm MST	I got it for the hair of 3000 dolls
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:42pm MST	Nissan Altima 2004
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:42pm MST	What year
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 6:33pm MST	I don't see it. Was there something important in it?
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 9:06am MST	You there?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 15, 2016 at 8:45am MST	Are you at the zoo yet Jos√©
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 7:21pm MST	I'm starting to think maybe you do understand the young people.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 10:02am MST	I have been resurrected
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 12:13am MST	I think he's dead...
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 12:03am MST	Omg emanuel did you see the Google thing?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:44pm MST	I think a shot of half and half has like 500 calories...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:40pm MST	That's just screaming dehydration...
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:35pm MST	See?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:34pm MST	They are shots though
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:34pm MST	Why not just shots?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:22pm MST	Paul, you da real MVP.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:19pm MST	Yeah that's &quot;I don't fuck with you&quot; by Big Sean
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:17pm MST	Never mind
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, August 13, 2016 at 11:17pm MST	Oh
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 12:14pm MST	I would be very happy with you sending drunk gibberish to us
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 11:33am MST	Didn't invite me or anything...
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 11:30am MST	Yeah but I'm going to start learning shit ahead of time because I'm legally retarded when it comes to physics.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 11:21am MST	Olivia I sent the physics book
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, August 9, 2016 at 7:53pm MST	Maybe you could just put in some logic like if the last 100 partial sums were 0.001 or less apart then stop. But yeah I'm not sure how to figure out how fast that'll happen
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 7:31pm MST	It's ok though we like you.
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 7:28pm MST	Perhaps it's destiny, you might have met your end on that cursed bike ride, and the flat saved you. Nevertheless, we'll all pray for your tire.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 10:24am MST	Is anyone ready for lunch?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 8:58am MST	Damn. I got here way too early apparently.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 8, 2016 at 8:57am MST	I'm on my way to the pokestop trifecta. Where are you
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	And do drugs
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	Also we should get drunk
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	I think we should eat lunch
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 8:46pm MST	Wtf Emanuel Ûæå¥
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, August 7, 2016 at 8:43pm MST	Early as fuck so I can get my poster printed.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 11:01pm MST	I thoroughly enjoyed this.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 9:17pm MST	Transfer it to a floppy disk. Oh and lastly you have to delete system 32. Then reboot your computer and bam. Now you should have 32 more gigs of ram than when you started.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 9:14pm MST	First you have to open Linux and make sure that there aren't any updates you have to install.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, August 6, 2016 at 6:04pm MST	BTW, that's me if I was a pirate.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 6:47pm MST	Since we were talking about Arthur the other day
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 12:19pm MST	We are already here
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 12:11pm MST	We invited you
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 12:03pm MST	Olivia so do you hate us too now?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:56am MST	So jelly...I love cactus grill
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:36am MST	Right? I'm just trying to spend time with you guys since we didn't have class Wednesday
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:34am MST	Jose and Olivia, I know you guys are on campus too. If you hate me and Paul just say it.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:29am MST	Cactus grill
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:29am MST	Dope. Where you wanna go?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:28am MST	I'm hungry but I don't have a car...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, August 5, 2016 at 11:18am MST	Hahaha
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 8:16pm MST	Lol what's the 17 year old equivalent to life alert?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:42pm MST	I know what we're gonna get you for your next birthday
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:40pm MST	RIP Olivia
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:28pm MST	And I was trying to ride next to the pole without going into the dirt but then I started veering into the dirt and I was going down hill and I don't have handbrakes only coaster breaks and then there was this palm tree all of the sudden that I had to swerve not to hit and I was going so fast and I fell and almost died.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:26pm MST	And I was riding right and there's like this bump for the gate of the park, like a metal track, and then a speed bump, then there's this tiny gap on the sidewalk because there's one of those stupid poles
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:19pm MST	I fell off my goddamn bike
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 7:16pm MST	What happened?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 3:19pm MST	I could probably do a study on that.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 3:18pm MST	I might take a shit on this poster when I don't need it anymore
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 1:40pm MST	paulhacosta@email.arizona.edu
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 1:37pm MST	Same
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 1:37pm MST	Olivia, can you forward me the email Sophia forwarded to you
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 1:18pm MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 1:18pm MST	Emanuel that has to be your first car
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 12:30pm MST	But my mentors department paid, not MARC
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 12:30pm MST	The glossy is $45, matte is $20. He also said the glossy starts to fade after 8-9 months
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 12:29pm MST	$45
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 11:08am MST	Seriously though, the glossy is worth the extra $25 it looks way better
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 10:45pm MST	I did
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 10:44pm MST	I'm going to
Daniel Osorio	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 10:27pm MST	hey guys, did you include your abstracts in your posters?
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:44pm MST	MARC coming up clutch with the funding
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:30pm MST	Off
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:17pm MST	Aw thanks. Aren't you on scholarship?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:15pm MST	Why?
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:09pm MST	We could move if you need an outlet
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 3:08pm MST	There's one at the copy center, not far.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:47pm MST	My mentor would be nice to you
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:44pm MST	Jubilant instead of happy and now despise instead of hate. Smh
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:32pm MST	*chat
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:28pm MST	It just says you need to tell people enough so that they know what the fuck you're talking about
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	&quot;Introduction should provide enough information to tell the reader the significance and your hypothesis/claims&quot;
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:25pm MST	I dont see why an abstract and an intro are both necessary
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:23pm MST	Walking downstairs
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	Even though the email Cindy sent us said that our layout, etc was up to us and our mentors.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:19pm MST	Tischler told sophia that we are required to include an abstract, intro, methods, etc on our poster
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:18pm MST	Im so lost
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:17pm MST	I think it's because ABRCMS requires it.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 2:15pm MST	I think why Tischler says an intro is important is because it has to be thorough enough so that the rest of the poster makes sense
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:11am MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:11am MST	I'm on my way too.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, August 3, 2016 at 8:10am MST	Goddammit I just pulled in.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 9:44pm MST	I'm about to get so many sleeps
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 9:44pm MST	Not enough sleeps
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 9:43pm MST	I think you need to use the sleep, because that made no sense.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 9:13pm MST	Do we have class tomorrow?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:56am MST	Right. Tell your lab person thanks for nothing, and thank you for the picture of a rainbow emanuel it was very thoughtful of you.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:56am MST	Some people are blind to colors. Some people are blind to thankfulness
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:54am MST	She didn't even thank you Emanuel
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:51am MST	http://designbycoffee.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/colors.jpg
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:50am MST	Can you ask him if these are two close? Cause my color scheme is on fleek and I don't wanna change it if I don't have to...
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:29am MST	Yes lol I wanna make sure it's colorblind friendly right?
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, August 2, 2016 at 11:23am MST	Are any of you guys colorblind?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:44pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:44pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:44pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:37pm MST	Omg lol Paul I want you to remember this gif when you take Dr. Pimentel's mcb181 class because that's basically what he looks like.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:31pm MST	Now I feel like I can post this:
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:30pm MST	ÛæÅî
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:25pm MST	Yeah I don't mind waking up early I feel super productive when I do I just have to go to bed early too. Like there's probably something wrong with me lol I don't think that's normal
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:24pm MST	If I don't get enough sleep like more than one day in a row, I get headaches, I feel dizzy and nauseous, I get muscle fatigue...
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:22pm MST	I need at least like 8 sleeps every day but sometimes I get 9 or 10 and it's soooo good. Y'all will understand when you're old like me.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:22pm MST	I can help but respect that.
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:20pm MST	I was but Scott is taking me home cause I started getting cranky. Cause it's past my bedtime you see?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:20pm MST	Are you pokemon going right now?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:19pm MST	Like 9pm. Sometimes 8:30
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:13pm MST	I'll tell you what, I'll stay up past my bedtime, you guys can Skype me and I'll take a shot with you,
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:12pm MST	You can still invite whoever, they just need a percentage to adjust their calculations. We take partying rather seriously haha
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:09pm MST	Lol
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:04pm MST	Idk it's probably past my bedtime...
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 8:35pm MST	Will do. Olivia are you going?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 7:41pm MST	Yeah that's fine, as long as it's the 2:1
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 7:35pm MST	ÛæÅî
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 7:31pm MST	Who did you have in mind?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 5:17pm MST	Olivia, I agree
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 5:15pm MST	I don't know why were submitting them so early, the ABRCMS website says they're not even due til September 9th
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 5:00pm MST	Yeah, I turned it in but emailed Cindy that I don't have final approval. You don't think they'll get printed right away?
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 4:52pm MST	Did you guys have your PIs review your abstract?
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:52pm MST	Oh right, duh.
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:52pm MST	Nah the second girl has glasses
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:50pm MST	You coulda said no way jose
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:19pm MST	(This is your moment Jos√©, your one opportunity...)
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:15pm MST	(Jose this is your chance)
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 3:03pm MST	Plus Jos√© still hates us.

Jose Celaya	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 2:12pm MST	Oui
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 2:12pm MST	We
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 2:12pm MST	When you talked about your work, did you say &quot;I&quot; of &quot;we&quot;
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:08am MST	Which we are apparently not...
Jose Celaya	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:06am MST	Paul got a 6 on the writing, we should be giving him a harder time. I can count to twelf but I can't spell it
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:03am MST	I'm confused, I thought Jos√© could drink 12 shots before he gets drunk?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:01am MST	See, he doesn't want to
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 11:00am MST	Emanuel, Jos√© doesn't want to get drunk
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 10:56am MST	I haven't started
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 8:06am MST	Plus you broke your pinky promise so you're still dead to me until you fix that...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, August 1, 2016 at 8:05am MST	Olivia you're alive!
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 31, 2016 at 1:12pm MST	I'll need it.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 31, 2016 at 1:04pm MST	I thought the poster was due tomorrow, and I told my mentor that. These past few days have been a scramble to get done during which my inattention to detail has become very apparent to my mentor. The good news is that I have more time, but the bad news is I have to tell again that I fucked up.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 9:43pm MST	My lab asked me today if I played pokemon go
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 9:05pm MST	I crossed a street before the crossing thing told me to
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 9:04pm MST	What did you do?!
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 9:04pm MST	I would been down if I wasn't busy getting pulled over on my bike
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 29, 2016 at 8:47pm MST	Finally heading to Reid park if anyone wants to come
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 7:30pm MST	What if we want a real tattoo
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 3:57pm MST	I live 15 minutes from campus the exact opposite direction
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 3:54pm MST	That's so far...
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 3:53pm MST	Also, I don't regularly check Facebook
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 2:53pm MST	Donde?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 2:52pm MST	I was waiting for Paul to answer cause I wanna see Paul Pok√©mon hunt
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 28, 2016 at 2:50pm MST	I guess that's a nope from everyone else...

Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 10:37pm MST	This.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 9:41pm MST	I've been too lazy to click on every Pok√©mon individually
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 8:01pm MST	Better use an egg. Did you transfer some in and get candies so you could figure out how many you have to evolve??
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 8:00pm MST	Also, whoever picked that orange color was a monster.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 8:00pm MST	I have yet to evolve all my Pok√©mon from last time.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 7:57pm MST	I prayed for you and all your Pokemon Olivia
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, July 27, 2016 at 6:31pm MST	Like you actually leaving or something
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, July 26, 2016 at 12:30pm MST	Ok cool, thanks

Jose Celaya	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 11:31am MST	I do it online
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 25, 2016 at 11:31am MST	ShareLatex

Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 24, 2016 at 7:36pm MST	Can I still listen to justice even though im a minority?
Jose Celaya	Sunday, July 24, 2016 at 6:19pm MST	Excellent question. I'd start out with some skrillex
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 24, 2016 at 10:45am MST	Did you have to throw tacos at them instead of razz berries?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 24, 2016 at 10:44am MST	Did they have good pokemon?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 24, 2016 at 10:44am MST	Omg he's not fucking dead.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 23, 2016 at 5:34pm MST	Scott and I are going to Reid park in a few hours to pokehunt if anyone wants to come.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, July 22, 2016 at 7:49pm MST	No his name is still in the title. He just doesn't have the app remember? He has to check through the browser
Jose Celaya	Friday, July 22, 2016 at 7:32pm MST	You guys gotta let up
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 22, 2016 at 7:31pm MST	But I thought emanuel and I were friends...we both love fried eggs on our hamburgers and hunting pokemon...
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 22, 2016 at 7:30pm MST	Well jose hates everybody, plus his mom probably wouldn't let him out to play anyway.
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 22, 2016 at 4:05pm MST	Nope. But I got an extension cause I'm fucked.

Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:40pm MST	Or she's thinking long term. We're probably gonna have decent jobs in the future. She's building the foundation for relationships
Paul Acosta Estrada	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:36pm MST	Obviously not us, but networking will get her a promisingly rich husband
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:33pm MST	Who though? Out of all the guys, I think the only one who could potentially make her a trophy wife right now is Dr Tischler
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:30pm MST	If Marissa wanted to be a trophy wife, why would she be in MARC?
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 10:28pm MST	But it's so magical.
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, July 21, 2016 at 6:42pm MST	I don't know how to take pics of my screen..

Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 19, 2016 at 6:08pm MST	I don't know about you, but I'm pretty damn good at cramming and eating.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 19, 2016 at 6:06pm MST	I am confident that if we put our minds to it, we can play Pokemon, eat, and cram all at the same time.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, July 19, 2016 at 5:00pm MST	I'm down to eat after class tomorrow
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, July 19, 2016 at 4:31pm MST	I'm fucking over the GRE. But if anyone wants to wreck some poke gyms with me until the GRE I'd be down.
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, July 19, 2016 at 4:30pm MST	Is there any other kind of studying?
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, July 19, 2016 at 4:19pm MST	Anyone down for some last minute studying after class tomorrow?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 8:36pm MST	How is he not moving his arms
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 3:12pm MST	Damn. That blows
Olivia Gorushi	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 3:12pm MST	I have to meet with Dr. Tischler, they might have me switch mentors because mine isn't teaching me shit
Paul Acosta Estrada	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 3:11pm MST	But why Olivia?
Emanuel Bustamante	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 2:55pm MST	Also file transfer protocol
Jose Celaya	Monday, July 18, 2016 at 11:05am MST	I literally just looked at all the papers I'm referencing, their references are out of order. The one my mentor wrote that we're basing this off of has all the references out of order.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 12:34pm MST	A 110 Onyx
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 12:27pm MST	I should do that. I have yet to write an essay
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 12:25pm MST	Ah. I'm about to finally take one of the computer practice tests for the gre...
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 12:24pm MST	He hasn't yet.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 6:11pm MST	Whoops

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:52pm MST	Ohhhh ok I thought you meant you guys talked about something one on one.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:52pm MST	He said a lot of stuff about my references and said there was no excuse for them to be bad even though we only talked about that for like 10 minutes
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:14pm MST	Did he give you a ton of corrections? He marked up paper almost everywhere but said &quot;generally very good&quot;...?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 5:02pm MST	Did any of you guys get feedback from dr. Tischler yet?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 9:12pm MST	Yessssss
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 9:12pm MST	Graveller?
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 9:11pm MST	Onyx?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 9:11pm MST	Not that one
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 8:47pm MST	Force evolution for Eevee https://imgur.com/gallery/vbQR6
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 6:51pm MST	We're gonna have to get him to call himself
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 6:50pm MST	Especially Jos√©
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 6:38pm MST	And it's pretty much the greatest thing I've ever heard. I think we should make it our ring tone for when jose calls us
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 15, 2016 at 6:38pm MST	So I finally just watched that video cause I got home to my WiFi.

Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, July 3, 2016 at 8:37am MST	Alright I gotta finish cleaning. If you guys want to pick up fireworks, go for it, I don't have a ton of them.

Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 3:07pm MST	3 whole Yeezys
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 3:06pm MST	You have 3 Yeezys?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 3:05pm MST	Well. At least 3, maybe 4, I can't remember if there's one in the fridge or not
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 3:04pm MST	I got three bottles at home.
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 3:04pm MST	Can you get A1 steak sauce?
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 3:03pm MST	You're probably right. So nobody wants anything?
Emanuel Bustamante	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 2:38pm MST	The amount of cottage cheese I've eaten would disgust you.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	Pizza is pretty much the only acceptable place for cheese.
Olivia Gorushi	Saturday, July 2, 2016 at 2:25pm MST	Because I'm a terrible person, obviously

Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 1:47pm MST	My melons are all the data I need
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 1:39pm MST	I'm gonna need you to compile your data into a poster
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, July 1, 2016 at 1:35pm MST	I don't believe you, so far I'm the only one in this chat to compliment your melons.

Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 4:32pm MST	Science and engineering library room 310? Or was it 301?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 8:47pm MST	I also vote option 1 if Jose is cool with it
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 8:45pm MST	It's life changing
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 8:43pm MST	That sounds amazing.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 8:36pm MST	I'm listening to my records and I decided you guys have to listen to dueling banjos.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 8:00pm MST	So the way I see it, we have a few options.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 8:00pm MST	It's doable, I just wanna make sure everyone is cool with that.
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 6:53pm MST	Scott and I are going to run up the mountain real quick and see what it looks like, I'll let you know
Jose Celaya	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 6:38pm MST	No, yeah I can't go up with you guys if you're going to shoot, it's my dad, I definitely want to go. Sorry guys
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 6:23pm MST	Whaaaaat
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 2:44pm MST	I just did the verbal and quantitative parts of practice test 2 in the book, scored 162 verbal and 167 quantitative
Paul Acosta Estrada	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 2:42pm MST	I'm confused
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 2:28pm MST	I hope you guys are ready to buy me dinner...
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 6:53am MST	But...why did you fill it out twice, with different responses???
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 11:38pm MST	I am. I filled out the form and everything.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 11:05pm MST	I can start a revolution with those
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 9:50pm MST	Do you think we have enough firearms for everybody?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 8:12pm MST	I talked to my parents and I am good for the barbeque. I'll fill out the survey when I get home.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 7:41pm MST	So we should all be good to go shooting on the mountain, as long as daniel is down for it.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 3:29pm MST	LOL me too emanuel
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 3:28pm MST	Same here. We don't have time sheets.
Olivia Gorushi	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 1:27pm MST	Lol definitely doing that now.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 1:20pm MST	If was the afternoon, don't exactly remember. But there's only two choices, morning or afternoon
Jose Celaya	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 12:25pm MST	Where are you?
Emanuel Bustamante	Tuesday, June 28, 2016 at 12:08pm MST	Oh Jesus I forgot
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:37pm MST	Perfect lol
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:28pm MST	How about Tuesday?
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:27pm MST	Ruhroh
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:22pm MST	It's by 5 pm
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:20pm MST	I'm assuming it's by the end of the day.
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:08pm MST	Oops wrong chat Lol
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:07pm MST	Si soy!!!
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 10:03pm MST	We did for that special reason haha just seemed like the safest way to go
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:57pm MST	It's cool.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:36pm MST	But I trust you guys to be responsible, otherwise I wouldn't be inviting you over. Still though, Scott and I could potentially get in a lot of trouble, so we're just trying to cover our asses.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:15pm MST	Basically I don't want us grown ups to be liable for anything. Y'all gotta behave yourselves at least until you leave my bbq and go to a real party.
Olivia Gorushi	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:14pm MST	And if you're driving, you surrender your keys until Scott or I say you're good to drive.
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 9:06pm MST	Will this be a BYPRD(bring your own red dirt) party. Also, will you refuse to serve me alcohol unless I put 21+ on the survey?
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 8:59pm MST	Now that's the real question
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 6:27pm MST	These motherfuckers
Emanuel Bustamante	Sunday, June 26, 2016 at 6:03pm MST	Olivia, I'm a maybe for the barbeque. My dad's birthday is on July 2nd and my mom's is on July 4th, so I may or may be in Phoenix on Sunday. I'll let you know when I know though.
Emanuel Bustamante	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 9:19am MST	That works for me
Olivia Gorushi	Friday, June 24, 2016 at 9:05am MST	Ok, at 5? Does that work for everybody?
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 23, 2016 at 2:34pm MST	I just sent it.
Emanuel Bustamante	Thursday, June 23, 2016 at 2:27pm MST	I'll down to reschedule
Olivia Gorushi	Thursday, June 23, 2016 at 1:49pm MST	I knew it. He hates us.
Emanuel Bustamante	Wednesday, June 22, 2016 at 2:56pm MST	Jose is going to get you
Olivia Gorushi	Wednesday, June 22, 2016 at 2:55pm MST	Dude I'm here you're not answering your phone where are you
Paul Acosta Estrada	Sunday, June 19, 2016 at 11:18pm MST	Hahahah bedtime.... Ok g-night!
